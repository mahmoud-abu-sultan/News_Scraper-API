    "articleBody": "Son Heung-min's late equaliser completed a stirring Tottenham fightback from two goals down in their 2-2 draw against top-four rivals Manchester United on Thursday.Just days after their 6-1 thrashing at Newcastle, troubled Tottenham looked set for another heavy Premier League defeat after United struck twice in the first half.Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford were United's scorers, but in their first match under caretaker manager Ryan Mason, Tottenham showed the kind of spirit that has been sorely lacking for much of their turbulent campaign.Pedro Porro's goal early in the second half gave them a lifeline and Son's close-range strike capped the escape act in the closing stages at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.While Tottenham's comeback was something of a morale boost during a difficult period, the result was still a blow to their faint hopes of qualifying for the Champions League via a top-four finish.Fifth-placed Tottenham are six points behind fourth-placed United, who have two games in hand, and eight adrift of third-placed Newcastle.Tottenham, without a trophy since 2008, still look likely to miss out on a lucrative Champions League berth, leaving them facing an uncertain future as the pressure on chairman Daniel Levy mounts.Levy took the brunt of the criticism from angry fans on Thursday as the tension from a shambolic season boiled over.There was mutiny in the north London air as supporters gathered outside the stadium before kick-off to call for his resignation.Chants with the same anti-Levy sentiment echoed throughout the game, while black balloons with the slogan '£NIC OUT' in reference to the ENIC company that owns Tottenham swirled around the stands as the chairman stared glumly from his seat in the directors' box.Tottenham's dismal campaign hit a new low on Sunday when they were hammered at Newcastle after conceding five goals in the first 21 minutes. - Spurs fightback - Interim boss Cristian Stellini was sacked after that humiliation, making him the second manager to leave the club this season after Antonio Conte's exit by \"mutual consent\" in March.Conte had departed after a disappointing 16-month reign that climaxed with his astonishing rant about Tottenham's \"selfish\" players and the losing culture at the club.In contrast to Tottenham's turmoil, United look positively stable despite the ongoing bidding war to buy the club from the Glazer family.They won the League Cup earlier this season and beat Brighton on penalties on Sunday to book an FA Cup final showdown with Manchester City.After conceding their first goal in the Newcastle rout after just two minutes, it took Tottenham's porous defence seven minutes to succumb this time.Rashford picked out Sancho on the left edge of the penalty area and the forward was gifted time and space to curl a fine finish into the far corner.Sancho's first goal in 14 appearances was almost followed by a second when his shot was headed off the line by Ivan Perisic.Rashford had the measure of the Tottenham defence and in the 44th minute he broke clear to net his 29th goal this season.Sprinting onto Bruno Fernandes' pass, Rashford surged away from Eric Dier to guide a composed finish past Fraser Forster from eight yards.Tottenham put up a better fight in the second half and Clement Lenglet headed against the bar from Perisic's cross.Porro, a much-maligned January signing from Sporting Lisbon, reduced the deficit in the 56th minute when the right-back blasted past David De Gea from just inside the area.Fernandes hit the bar when it looked easier to score after the United midfielder rampaged through the Tottenham defence.Son wasted a glorious chance to equalise, scuffing wide with just De Gea to beat, while Dier missed an equally good headed opportunity.Tottenham were pouring forward with renewed belief and Son netted their deserved equaliser when he tapped in Kane's cross at the far post in the 79th minute."

    "articleBody": "Villa are now unbeaten in 10 games as they make a late push for Europe thanks to a remarkable turnaround since Unai Emery took charge.\nTyrone Mings scored the only goal at Villa Park as the England international headed in John McGinn's corner after 21 minutes.\n\nEmery's men did not reach the heights they have in recent weeks, but did enough to edge above Tottenham and to climb within five points of the top four, albeit having played more games than Newcastle and Manchester United in the battle for a place in next season's Champions League.\n\nLeeds and Leicester remain perilously poised just above the relegation zone after the points were shared in an entertaining encounter at Elland Road.\n\nThe Foxes had won for the first time since February against Wolves on Saturday in Dean Smith's first home game in charge and looked to have made the perfect start when Youri Tielemans' strike found the top corner, but the goal was ruled out for offside against Boubakary Soumare.\n\nLeeds swiftly went up the other end to go in front when Luis Sinisterra headed in Jack Harrison's brilliant cross.\n\nJamie Vardy had not scored in the Premier League for six months, but picked the perfect time to net a huge goal 10 minutes from time when he latched onto James Maddison's pass.\n\nVardy then had the ball in the net again only to be denied by the offside flag.\n\nBut Leeds will feel they should have snatched a vital win at the death as Patrick Bamford fluffed a great chance after Daniel Iversen saved from Marc Roca and Brenden Aaronson.\n\nA draw leaves Leeds still one point ahead of Leicester, who themselves edge one point clear of the bottom three.\n\nWolves moved to the brink of survival by pulling nine points clear of the relegation zone after inflicting Roy Hodgson's first defeat since returning as Crystal Palace manager with a 2-0 win at Molineux.\n\nThe goals came early and late as Joachim Andersen's own goal gave Wolves the perfect start after just three minutes.\n\nRuben Neves then made sure of the victory from the penalty spot deep into stoppage time to take Wolves level on points with Palace in 13th."

    "articleBody": "Erling Haaland scored his 45th goal of the season as Manchester City took a commanding 3-0 first leg lead over Bayern Munich in their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday.Rodri and Bernardo Silva were also on target for the English champions, who took a giant stride towards finally conquering Europe for the first time.Bayern boss Thomas Tuchel got the better of Guardiola and City when Chelsea manager in the 2021 final.But in 11 meetings between the two coaches, Guardiola has still only lost three times and got the better of his German counterpart in a heavyweight clash between two of the favourites to win the competition.Guardiola has been regularly criticised for overly tinkering with his side when it comes to the crunch in the Champions League knockout stages.But it was Tuchel who made some bold calls with his team selection as Thomas Mueller and Sadio Mane were left on the bench, alongside Joao Cancelo on his return to the Etihad after joining Bayern on loan in January.City fought off interest from Bayern among other European giants to win the race to sign Erling Haaland a year ago for nights like this.The 22-year-old duly delivered in the end but uncharacteristically fluffed his lines with the first big chance of the game when his weak shot was straight at Yann Sommer.At the other end, City were grateful to a brilliant block from Ruben Dias to prevent Jamal Musiala putting Bayern in front.Rodri then showed the forwards how it is done as the Spaniard took aim from long range on his weaker left foot and curled a sumptuous shot into the top corner.Bayern picked up Sommer in the January window as an emergency measure after Manuel Neuer's season was ended by a skiing accident.The Swiss international proved the value of that move with a number of vital saves to keep Bayern in the tie, starting with an outstretched leg to deny Ilkay Gundogan.Leroy Sane was also returning to the Etihad after four years at City and three times the Bayern winger came close to haunting his former club either side of half-time.Sane flashed a shot wide from distance before the break and was denied by two big saves from Ederson early in the second half.Bayern were made to regret not making their bright start to the second period count as Matthijs de Ligt and Kingsley Coman had headers from close range blocked by desperate City defending.Instead, City turned the screw in the final quarter to take a potentially decisive lead to Bavaria next week.Haaland showed there is more to his game than goals with a perfectly weighted cross for Silva to head in City's second 20 minutes from time.Sommer then produced a fine stop low to his left to turn Julian Alvarez's shot to safety.But City were not to be denied their third and Haaland his goal as the Norwegian stretched out a telescopic leg to turn John Stones' knockdown beyond Sommer.Alvarez fired another effort inches wide and Sommer needed finger tips to turn over Rodri's header as City went in search of a final flourish.But Bayern will need one of the Champions League's all-time great comebacks in eight days' time if City are to be denied a third consecutive semi-final."

We're 13 points clear, but our objective remains the same.\"Xavi, still without several key players including Pedri and Ousmane Dembele, lined up with Ansu Fati and Raphinha alongside La Liga's top scorer Robert Lewandowski up front.The Polish forward came close to opening the scoring on four minutes after being teed up by Fati, whipping an effort onto the roof of the net.Barcelona came close again when Girona defender Santi Bueno almost put through his own net but goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga reacted well to slide in and divert the ball to safety.The former Tottenham goalkeeper saved well from Raphinha at his near post and then clawed away a Ronald Araujo effort from the resulting corner.Barcelona appealed that the ball had gone in but with the help of VAR -- La Liga does not use goal-line technology -- officials decided the ball did not cross the line.\n                  \nGirona blow chance\n                  \nEric Garcia headed over from a corner early in the second half as Barcelona kept looking for the opener.However the best chance of the game fell to the visitors, with Taty Castellanos spurning the opportunity by firing wide when through on goal, with Ivan Martin alongside in support, ready for a tap-in.Xavi threw on defender Jordi Alba as a left winger as he looked for better delivery in the final third, and he made an instant impact with a dangerous cross and some neat interplay with Lewandowski.Gazzaniga made another fine save to tip over Gavi's header from a corner in stoppage time as Barcelona finally showed some urgency, but it was too late.Lewandowski had a late backheel deflected wide as Girona clung on for the draw.The Catalans took a meek step towards their title dream, extending their lead on Madrid by a point."

    "articleBody": "Napoli are 19 points clear of closest challengers Lazio after Gallo's unwitting backpass from a Mario Rui cross slipped through the fingers of surprised Lecce goalkeeper Wladimiro Falcone midway through the second half.The hosts had been deservedly level with Napoli at the Stadio Via del Mare after Federico Di Francesco's powerfully struck finish cancelled out Giovanni Di Lorenzo's 18th-minute header.Di Francesco's second league goal of the season was his team's first since mid-February and had a tired-looking Napoli at risk of slipping to another defeat after they were hammered 4-0 by champions Milan last weekend.Instead Lecce stay eight points above the relegation zone in 16th while Napoli take another step towards a historic Scudetto with their seventh straight league away win, earned without top scorer Victor Osimhen.\"It wasn't easy getting the result after that defeat (to Milan)... this result gives us some comfort ahead of the coming matches,\" Napoli coach Luciano Spalletti told DAZN. Nigeria forward Osimhen might be back for Wednesday's first leg of the all-Italian quarter-final with third-placed Milan -- who face Empoli in Friday's late match -- but they look to have lost his replacement Giovanni Simeone to a thigh injury he suffered late on.\"Osimhen wants to play every match... but these are situations that need to be assessed properly,\" added Spalletti. As it stands Spalletti's team only need four more wins from their final nine matches to secure the title, and that target will get smaller if Lazio fail to beat Juventus.However it will be all change if Juve have their 15-point penalty for illicit transfer activity revoked later this month, as they are 11 points behind Lazio ahead of their clash at the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday.\n                  \nMilan flop\n                  \nMilan flopped at the San Siro ahead of Napoli's visit as Stefano Pioli's much-changed side failed to break down defensive Empoli.The hosts thought they had claimed the points in the final moments when substitute Olivier Giroud netted but his strike was rightly ruled out for handball after he celebrated.That was the second time supporters were ruing VAR officials after Milan were also denied a penalty on the hour after Tyronne Ebuehi had initially been penalised for handball.Empoli held out for a draw which meant third-placed Milan failed to fully capitalise on another bad evening for Romelu Lukaku in rivals Inter Milan's 1-1 draw at Salernitana.Antonio Candreva's miscued cross in the final minute moved Salernitana 10 points above the relegation zone and left Inter at risk of being knocked out of the Champions League positions.Wasteful Inter would have been out of sight before old boy Candreva's fortuitous strike had they made the most of their opportunities after Robin Gosens netted their first goal from open play in a month in the sixth minute, with Lukaku the worst culprit in Salerno.Lukaku, who was racially abused by Juventus fans midweek, headed a simple opportunity straight at Guillermo Ochoa in the first half. And he somehow managed to scoop a diving header onto the bar from inside the six-yard box in the 65th minute before the superb Ochoa brilliantly kept out Stefan De Vrij on the rebound.\"Our big regret is that we couldn't get that second goal, right now we keep paying a heavy price for not killing matches off,\" said Inter coach Simone Inzaghi.Fourth-placed Inter are a point behind Milan and head to Benfica for the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday winless in six and in the midst of a goalscoring crisis.Inzaghi's side are just one point ahead of Roma, who are at Torino on Sunday, while sixth-placed Atalanta can also move above Inter on goal difference if they beat Bologna."

The well-travelled 29-year-old converted into the bottom corner from the spot. Bosetti, who has had spells in the USA, Norway after coming through hometown club Nice's academy, was shown a yellow card for taking off his shirt celebrating the goal. With 25 minutes left, Toulouse coach Philippe Montanier replaced Brazilian Rafael Ratao with Chaibi, in just his second season of senior football. With five minutes to go the substitute claimed his side's place in the final. He chipped Annecy goalkeeper Thomas Callens for a third goal in the competition this season. The home side thought they had taken the game into extra time but substitute Moise Sahi's half-volley from 30 metres was ruled out for offside with 90 seconds of the seven minutes of injury time played. Toulouse, in mid-table in Ligue 1, held on despite Annecy's late pressure to secure their first final appearance since winning the cup in 1957."

Considered one of the hottest prospects on the tour, Lehecka, who beat top seed Andrey Rublev in the quarter-final, served first, went 15-40 down, had two advantage points and then let Murray take over.The Czech rediscovered his big serve and powerful returns for the second set when he broke Murray's serve in straight games.Murray reclaimed two match points on his serve in the deciding set and Lehecka had three more when serving at 5-4. Murray took the game and held his nerve in the tie break.\"This week could have ended very differently,\" admitted the former two-time Wimbledon champion.\"But the way that I have played in the really important moments, the critical moments, has shown that there is a confidence and a belief in my game that has been missing for a while.\"Murray last reached an ATP final in Stuttgart last June. He has not won a tournament since Antwerp in 2019 and has lost to Medevedev in straight sets in each of their two meetings.Medevedev said Murray's performance in Doha has been \"unbelievable\".\"I will have to be at my best from the first to the last point,\" said the Russian.\"He is a legend,\" Medvedev added. \"He is playing better and better, not only here but in general. He is fighting, it is amazing to see.\"The Russian has now beaten Auger-Aliassime in all six matches they have played, including in the quarter-finals in Rotterdam last week where Medvedev took the title.Auger-Aliassime managed three set points to take the second set and stay in the match but made errors in the tie break."

    "articleBody": "The Serbian fourth seed overcame an early wobble to romp past unseeded American Tommy Paul 7-5, 6-1, 6-2 on Rod Laver Arena in style. Another title on Sunday will move him alongside Rafael Nadal with 22 Slam wins and see the 35-year-old return to world number one for the first time since last June.Greek third seed Tsitsipas, who ground past Russian 18th seed Karen Khachanov 7-6 (7/2), 6-4, 6-7 (6/8), 6-3 in the other semi-final, can also become the top-ranked player should he lift the trophy.Djokovic played the clash without father Srdjan courtside after he was filmed posing with a man holding a Russian flag featuring Vladimir Putin's face following his son's quarter-final win on Wednesday.The incident sparked a backlash from Ukraine and led to calls for Djokovic's father to be banned from the tournament.Srdjan issued a statement ahead of the semi-final saying he would stay away, insisting he \"wishes only for peace\" and never wanted to cause \"disruption\". There was an empty seat next to his mother Dijana during the match.\"I'm really thankful that I have enough gas in my legs to be able to play at this level on one of the biggest tennis courts in the world,\" said Djokovic, who is now 11-0 for the season and into a 33rd Grand Slam final.\"Of course, I'm not as fresh as the beginning of the tournament but we put in a lot of hours in the off-season on fitness in order to be in a good condition to play best of five (sets).\"I know what's expected of me, I've been in this situation so many times in my career. Experience helps also,\" he added of being in another final.     The win extended his unbeaten streak at the Australian Open to 27 matches to claim sole ownership of the Open-era record at Melbourne Park ahead of Andre Agassi.Djokovic had never played Paul before and said he was wary of a \"very explosive, very dynamic player\", with the American initially refusing to go quietly.\n                  \nTsitsipas Dream                   \n                  \nThe Serb, a hot favourite, attacked his opponent's straight away for an early break, then broke again when the 35th-ranked Paul fired a forehand long to race 5-1 in front.A run-in with the umpire over using his towel between points seemed to rattle Djokovic and he was broken twice in a row as Paul came surging back to 5-5.Djokovic regrouped to hold serve and break again and take the set in 59 minutes.After that wobble, it was all business, despite clutching his strapped hamstring several times, romping through the next two sets with minimal resistence.He will meet Tsitsipas next after the Greek battled into his first Australian final and only second at a Grand Slam.In the previous one, at Roland Garros in 2021, he fell to Djokovic in five sets after holding a 2-0 lead.At 24, Tsitsipas is the youngest man to reach the Melbourne final since a 23-year-old Djokovic in 2011. \"I dreamed as a kid to maybe one day get to play in this court against the best players in the world,\" said Tsitsipas, who is also unbeaten this season with a 10-0 record.\"I'm extremely happy that I'm in the final now and let's see what happens.\"Tsitsipas has thrived in Melbourne throughout his career after bursting on the scene at the 2019 event as a 20-year-old when he dethroned defending champion Roger Federer in the last 16.He went on to reach the semi-finals that year and again in 2021 and 2022. He came into his clash with Khachanov brimming with confidence.Despite failing to get over the line when serving for the match at 5-4 in the third set, then with two match points in the tiebreak, he kept his cool to secure the win and a date with Djokovic."

I feel blessed, blessed that I'm able to play tennis at this level. I've been wanting for many years now to put Greek tennis on the map.\"I'm extremely happy that I'm in the final now and let's see what happens,\" he added.Tsitsipas has thrived in Melbourne throughout his career after bursting on the scene at the 2019 event as a 20-year-old when he dethroned defending champion Roger Federer in the last 16.He went on to reach the semi-finals that year and again in 2021 and 2022 -- falling one match short on each occasion -- to highlight the consistency that has made him a mainstay of the world's top 10 for nearly four years.But a Grand Slam crown remains elusive, with his runner-up showing at Roland Garros in 2021 his best result so far, falling to Djokovic in five sets after holding a 2-0 lead.Tsitsipas came into the Khachanov clash brimming with confidence, further fuelled by enjoying a 5-0 record over the Russian.He opened with a serve to love and applied early pressure, earning a break in game four when Khachanov made a baseline error.But the advantage didn't last with the 18th seed immediately striking back to level it up when Tsitsipas netted a forehand.The Greek star, though, was unrelenting on the forehand and forced another break for a 5-3 lead, only for Khachanov to again roar back.It went to a tiebreak with Tsitsipas quickly taking charge.\n                  \nCool Tsitsipas                   \n                  \nKhachanov repelled three break points early in a second set which went with serve until Tsitsipas earned another two after a 22-shot rally at 4-4, and this time he made no mistake.With the bit between his teeth, the third seed ramped up the pressure to secure a break for 2-1 in the third set, then consolidated.Khachanov looked down and out but in a late twist broke back when Tsitsipas -- two points from victory -- sent an overhead volley wide as he served for the match. It propelled the third set to another tiebreak, where the Greek worked two match points on serve, but failed to convert and the Russian pulled through to take drag it to a fourth.Tsitsipas, whose mantra in Melbourne has been to focus on the positives not the negatives, kept his cool and plugged away to break again for 2-0, and this time there was no comeback."

She won the recent WTA Adelaide International and had not dropped a set in 2023 in eight matches.The world number five had reached the US Open semi-finals in each of the last two seasons and made the final four at Wimbledon in 2021. By contrast, 64th-ranked Croatian Vekic, aged 26, has been working her way back to the top 20 after knee surgery two years ago that she thought might end her career. It was only her second major quarter-final after the 2019 US Open. But Vekic had won five of the pair's six meetings, including at the Tokyo Olympics and in San Diego last October,  and she was able to put fierce pressure on Sabalenka's serve early on.The Belarusian withstood the onslaught, saving three break points to lead 2-1.She broke Vekic to love for 3-1 but the Croatian got straight back on serve in the next game, securing it on the first of two more break points.Vekic's serve remained shaky and she had to save break points in each of her service games, not helped by seven double faults in her first three service games.Vekic tried to mix up her play, delicate drop shots and punishing forehand winners creating more openings on Sabalenka's serve.But this version of Sabalenka, who has so often been unhinged by nerves in the past, refused to buckle and edged ahead again before taking a decisive break to lead 5-3.Vekic still had a chance to level as Sabalenka served for the set. But she went just wide with an attempted forehand winner and Sabalenka prevailed 6-3 after a titanic 60-minute battle.\"I think just because I was calm and I kind of expect this game from her,\" said Sabalenka, 24.\"So I was able to stay in the game no matter what. So I think this was the key.\"Sabalenka had the momentum and put the Vekic serve under more pressure at the start of the second set, stretching out to a double break for 3-0 as the Croat's double fault count soared to 12.Sabalenka wobbled, serving two double faults and facing break points, as she had done on every service game, when serving for the match at 5-2.After three deuces and with the tension rising, Sabalenka got over the line on her first match point."

    "articleBody": "Rybakina swept past the 2022 French and US Open winner Swiatek 6-4, 6-4 in 1hr 29min on Rod Laver Arena.\n\nShe moves on to a quarter-final against Jelena Ostapenko, who provided the second upset of a crazy few minutes at Melbourne Park by knocking out seventh seed Coco Gauff 7-5, 6-3 on the neighbouring Margaret Court Arena.\n\nRybakina's victory means the top two seeds in both the men's and women's singles are all out of the first Grand Slam of the year before the last-eight stage.\n\n\"It was a really tough match and I really respect Iga,\" said Rybakina, the 22nd seed. \n\n\"She's a young player and think she played really well,\" she added of the 21-year-old from Poland. \"It's a big win and I'm just happy to get to another round.\"\n\nSwiatek led 40-0 on her opening service game and 15-40 on Rybakina's delivery in the next.\n\nBut it was the 6ft (1.84m) tall Russian-born player, who now represents Kazakhstan, who showed her resilience and power to win both for an early 2-0 lead.\n\nThe Pole composed herself to hold in the next and then went on the attack, creating three break points and converting the first when Rybakina went long to level the set at 2-2.\n\nAt 3-3, 30-30, Swiatek's first double fault gave Rybakina another chance which she seized with a sizzling backhand crosscourt return.\n\nThe Wimbledon champion comfortably served out, powering down her fourth ace on her first set point to move ahead after 42 minutes.\n                  \n- Important moments -                  \n                  \nSwiatek stepped up at start of the second set, attacking off her forehand and broke immediately for 2-0 to chants of \"Iga, Iga\" from a small, but noisy, contingent of Polish fans clad in red and white.\n\nThe cries were short-lived. \n\nThe 23-year-old Rybakina broke to love at 1-3 as Swiatek's first serve deserted her.\nRybakina, by contrast, was now firing down serves with power and accuracy, her fifth ace helping her to level at 3-3.\n\n\"I think I was serving good and just struggling a bit on one side,\" said the composed Rybakina.\n\n\"But in the important moments I played really well and that made the difference.\"\nSwiatek had won the pair's only previous meeting in straight sets at Ostrava in 2021.\n\nBut history counted for nothing against the confident Kazakh who forced Swiatek to save two break points at 4-4.\n\nA sixth forehand winner of the match from Rybakina created a third, which she took when the Pole netted and served out with ease to take the match. \n\nNext door, Ostapenko edged a tight battle in an 1hr 33min, stepping up when it counted at the end of each set to reach the quarter-finals at Melbourne Park for the first time.\n\n\"I knew she's such a great player, super young and she's playing really well but I really had nothing to lose,\" said Ostapenko, who won at Roland Garros in 2017 and earned her fifth WTA Tour title in Dubai last year.\n\n\"I just went there and tried to show my best and try to fight for every point and to make it hard for her and I'm really happy with the way I played.\"\n\nOstapenko, whose last Grand Slam quarter-final came at Wimbledon in 2018, has endured some tough injury-hit years since and had never before beaten a player ranked inside the top-10 at the Australian Open.\n\n\"I was trying to stay positive all the time,\" said Ostapenko. \"And I knew I have to play aggressive, even if I miss some balls.\n\n\"At the end, I think I kept her under so much pressure and it brought me a win.\""

    "articleBody": "An ailing Novak Djokovic said Saturday every moment counted now that he was in the \"last stage\" of his career, after battling past Grigor Dimitrov and into the Australian Open last 16.The Serb came through a titanic 77-minute first set before taming the Bulgarian 7-6 (9/7), 6-3, 6-4 on Rod Laver Arena, needing treatment twice on his troublesome hamstring.He will face home hope Alex de Minaur for a place in the quarter-finals after the 22nd seed equalled his best result at the tournament by defeating Frenchman Benjamin Bonzi in three sets.Djokovic's gutsy win inched him nearer to a 10th Australian Open title and record-tying 22 Grand Slam crowns.Winning once again in Melbourne would also return him to world number one for the first time since June.Now 35, Djokovic said he was savouring each tournament more.\"Every season counts I guess now, when you come to the last stage, the last quarter, of your career,\" he said.\"Obviously you start appreciating and valuing each tournament more because you might not have a lot left in the tank.\"I've been truly fortunate to do what I love, I love the sport, I love competing. It's been almost 20 years now of professional sport. I can't be more grateful than I am.\"Victory put Djokovic into the last 16 for a 15th time but he was made to work for it, especially with his left hamstring troubling him.\"Every point, every game mattered,\" he said.\"Obviously I didn't know how I'm going to feel physically, it was going up and down,\" he said.\"It was an incredible battle, three sets over three hours.\"Djokovic aggravated his hamstring during his run to a 92nd title at the Adelaide International this month and has been struggling with it since. - 'Ready for the battle' - Djokovic came into the match without his usual off-day practice session to give his leg as much time as possible to recover.With his left thigh heavily strapped, the Serb broke immediately and consolidated to take an early grip on the first set.He was cruising but appeared to feel the injury when moving for a shot at 5-3. He managed to earn three set points, which were saved, but was then broken when serving for the set at 5-4.Agitated, he complained to the umpire about being given a time violation and was then forced to save two set points, before an epic tiebreak.He eventually got over the line on his fifth set point after some intense tennis.Djokovic took a medical timeout at the changeover and returned to dial up the pressure and take a break before comfortably seeing out the second set.With Dimitrov flagging, he turned the screws further by breaking twice early in set three.Despite a mid-set wobble when the Bulgarian clawed back and then more treatment on his leg, Djokovic battled to the finish line.De Minaur, who is aiming for a first quarter-final at Melbourne Park, now awaits Djokovic after a 7-6 (7/0), 6-2, 6-1 victory.\"These are the matches you want to be playing,\" said the Australian.\"I'm gonna probably have the best in the world in front of me and I'm ready for the battle.\""

    "articleBody": "Defending champion Rafael Nadal hobbled out of the second round in a major upset at the Australian Open on Wednesday, but there was no such trouble for the leading women's stars.The Spanish great's wife Mery was in tears as Nadal was beaten by 65th-ranked Mackenzie McDonald at Rod Laver Arena, where the roof was closed because of more rain in Melbourne.The 36-year-old Nadal was clearly hindered by a hip issue that required a medical timeout, as he surrendered 6-4, 6-4, 7-5 to the American.It was the reigning champion's earliest exit from a major in seven years and will lead to more questions about whether injury and age are catching up with the record 22-time major champion.The men's title now looks Novak Djokovic's to lose.Nadal said defeat \"hurt\" and acknowledged that injuries were taking a toll.\"I've never been in a position to complain, life has given me so many positive things that I have no right to complain,\" he said.\"(But) I am tired, I am sad, I am disappointed, all this is a reality.\"From here on... what I want is to continue playing tennis. Don't think I'm saying all this because I want to take a step back.\"It is not the case, but my current feelings are bad.\"In contrast to Nadal's disappointment and pain, 27-year-old McDonald is into the third round and a match against either Yoshihito Nishioka of Japan or Czech Republic's Dalibor Svrcina.\"He's an incredible champion, he's never going to give up regardless of the situation,\" said McDonald of his beaten opponent.\"I was trying to stay focused on what I was trying to do and he kind of got me out of my rhythm, and I just got through it.\"Melbourne's famously fickle weather played more havoc.On Tuesday play on most courts was stopped because of extreme heat, and then matches were suspended later in the day on outside courts by heavy rain.More rain fell on Wednesday as organisers frantically tried, but failed, to clear a backlog of matches.Only matches on the three main stadiums, which have roofs, were able to begin on time. The outside courts belatedly saw action in the early evening, but six hours of play was lost.In matches able to proceed under cover, Italian 15th seed Jannik Sinner dropped just seven games in blowing away Argentine Tomas Martin Etcheverry 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.Frances Tiafoe, the 16th seed, also defeated Chinese teenager Shang Juncheng in straight sets to reach round three.Sixth seed Felix Auger-Aliassime dropped the first two sets to Slovakia's Alex Molcan before roaring back to claim a dogged victory. - Sakkari rattled - In the women's draw, the top seeds continue to sail through largely untroubled.World number one Iga Swiatek and dangerous American Jessica Pegula led the charge into the third round.Polish title favourite Swiatek swept past Colombia's Camila Osorio 6-2, 6-3 while third seed Pegula downed Belarusian Aliaksandra Sasnovich 6-2, 7-6 (7/5).The three-time major winner Swiatek will face either 2019 US Open champion Bianca Andreescu of Canada or Spanish qualifier Cristina Bucsa in the third round.Greece's Maria Sakkari also went through, but she looked anything but the sixth seed in a 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 struggle against Russian qualifier and college student Diana Shnaider.Sakkari was irked by Shnaider's fist pumps and celebratory screams, before finding her composure.\"During a match, you can be very pumped,\" Sakkari said. \"But the way that some players celebrate their points, it's not appropriate. I wasn't happy with that.\"Madison Keys, the American 10th seed, also won.But Petra Kvitova, the 15th seed and former two-time Wimbledon champion, was defeated in straight sets by Anhelina Kalinina of Ukraine.Later Wednesday, American Coco Gauff and Britain's former US Open champion Emma Raducanu meet as the future of women's tennis goes on full display."

    "articleBody": "Serbian flags waved and Rod Laver Arena rose to give Novak Djokovic a rapturous welcome back to the Australian Open on Tuesday, a year after he was kicked out of the country.Novak Djokovic said he felt \"very much appreciated\" as he made a perfect return to the Australian Open with a ruthless victory over Spain's Roberto Carballes Baena on Tuesday.The Serb enjoyed a rousing reception at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne following his deportation a year ago as he launched his bid for a 10th Australian Open title in style.The 35-year-old, who missed last year's Grand Slam because of his stance on Covid vaccines, showed few signs of the hamstring niggle he picked up in Adelaide this month as he raced to an emphatic 6-3, 6-4, 6-0 win.There were concerns over how the former number one might be received by fans at Melbourne Park following the deportation saga 12 months ago.The city endured lengthy lockdowns during the height of the pandemic.But, as in Adelaide, the fourth seed walked out to loud cheers and chants of \"Nole\", with vocal backing during the match from a stadium awash with Serbian flags.\"Thank you for giving me such a welcoming reception that I could only dream of,\" said Djokovic, who is chasing a record-equalling 22nd major title.\"I feel really happy that I'm back here in Australia and on the court where I have had the biggest success in my career.\"Definitely this court is the most special court in my life and I couldn't ask for a better start to the tournament.\"He arrived at Melbourne Park in sizzling form after ending 2022 by winning another ATP Finals title, then followed that up by triumphing at the Adelaide International.As if that wasn't daunting enough for 75th-ranked Carballes Baena, Djokovic came into the clash having won his last 21 Australian Open matches.He opened with an ace, but didn't have it all his own way at first, needing to save three break points in the fifth game.But he quickly settled and broke the next game to love for a 4-2 lead and closed out the set.His hamstring appeared to trouble him briefly when he slid for a shot at 2-2 in the next set, but he pressed on and broke again for 4-3 when Carballes Baena netted a forehand.Djokovic stepped up a level as the clock ticked passed midnight in Melbourne and he immediately broke in the third set, with the Spaniard out of answers as the former world number one surged to victory.Asked afterwards about the welcome he was given, Djokovic said: \"Very much appreciated. I felt very welcome on the court, especially the Serbian community that is big here in Australia has welcomed me in an incredible way.\"So much support. So much love. I could not ask for a better start of the tournament in terms of support, in terms of how I felt on the court and also playing.\"He will play Bolivian Hugo Dellien or French qualifier Enzo Couacaud in the second round.- 'Really glad' - In Djokovic's absence last year, long-time rival Rafael Nadal won the title to claim a 21st Grand Slam which he stretched to 22 at the French Open.Djokovic won Wimbledon to take his haul to 21 and he has made no secret about wanting more.He said the left hamstring problem which has been bothering him for more than a week had been of no real concern.\"The leg is good. It's not ideal, but it's getting there. Today was a really good test,\" he said.\"Haven't had too much training in the last few days, to be honest with you, tennis-wise.\"I'm actually really glad that it felt better as the match progressed. The third set was great. That's a good signal, a good sign.\""

    "articleBody": "Seven-time grand slam winner Venus Williams overcame a player less than half her age on Monday in a vintage performance in the first round of the Auckland Classic.Playing her first match in four months, the 42-year-old unearthed some trademark power to notch a first win in more than a year, adding another footnote to a professional career that has stretched into a 27th season.An hour-long rain interruption worked in Williams' favour, as she resumed in style to beat fellow American Katie Volynets 7-6 (7/4), 6-2.Volynets, who turned 21 on New Year's Eve, was leading the first set tiebreaker when play was suspended but she faded in a match that stretched late into the evening.The former world No.1 is using this week to prepare for her 25th tilt at the Australian Open, having accepted a wildcard entry to the tournaments in Auckland and Melbourne.She admitted the stoppage worked in her favour although it didn't feel that way at the time.\"It's hard when you're all fired up and just suddenly you have to stop,\" said Williams, whose previous match was a first-round loss at the US Open.\"I was so mad on the rain break. My coach could barely talk to me so I'm going to try to improve my attitude.\"Williams has slipped outside the top 1,000 in the rankings but she showcased glimpses of her former class - and some creditable fitness - during the second set against 114th-ranked qualifier Volynets.The tournament is being staged for the first time in three years, with the 2020 edition having been won by retired great Serena Williams -- Venus' younger sister.Williams will face China's Zhu Lin in the second round, after she upset American sixth seed Madison Brengle 4-6, 7-6 (8/6), 6-4.Third seed Canadian Leylah Fernandez notched a rapid win, dropping just 14 points in a 6-1, 6-1 defeat of 15-year-old Czech wildcard Brenda Fruhvirtova.Top-seeded American and world No.7 Coco Gauff opens her campaign on Tuesday.Also in action are three former Grand Slam winners - Briton Emma Raducanu and US pair Sloane Stephens and Sofia Kenin."

Lots of young guys on the tour, a kind of shift of generations but you know, Nadal and myself, still going strong from the older guys.\"Despite being 35, Djokovic said he believed more Grand Slam success was possible and he could fend off the younger generation for some time yet.\"I know what I need to do in order to compete with them, in order to be one of the contenders for the title here and in Melbourne,\" he said.\"The good memories and good history that I have on Australian soil gives me a lot of positive emotions and belief that I can do it again and I can go far.\""

    "articleBody": "Two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Jokic finished with 34 points, 21 rebounds and 14 assists to give top-seeded Denver a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.Jokic received offensive support from Jamal Murray, who finished with 31 points, while four other Denver players posted double-digit points tallies.The Lakers were led by Anthony Davis, who scored 40 points with 10 rebounds. LeBron James added 26 points while Austin Reaves added 23 points.Denver led by 21 points in the third quarter but saw their lead whittled away to just three as the Lakers swept back into contention with a gutsy fourth-quarter fightback that ultimately fell just short.\"In the first half we were really good -- controlled the game, controlled everything, controlled the pace, controlled the defense and then second half we lost it,\" Jokic told ESPN.\"But whether you win by one point or win by 20 at this time of year, it doesn't matter -- a win is a win.\"Denver coach Michael Malone saluted his team's composure in closing out victory.\"A lot of our guys are battle-tested, we've been in a ton of close games,\" Malone said.\"I didn't think there was any panic -- there was poise. Our guys looked at one another and realized what we had to do to close this game out.\" James bemoaned the Lakers' slow start.\"It took us a half to get into the game and that was pretty much the ballgame right there,\" James said. \"We have to understand that we have to start from the tip-off -- and they punched us in the mouth to start.\"\n                  \n'Desperation'              \n                  \nWith a raucous Ball Arena home crowd roaring them on, the Nuggets took early control, surging into a 20-9 lead midway through the first quarter with a flurry of scoring that threatened to overwhelm the visitors.Jokic was at the heart of the opening onslaught, imposing himself with eight points, 12 rebounds and five assists in the first quarter alone to help the Nuggets take a 37-25 lead heading into the second quarter.Denver continued to score freely through the second quarter to take a commanding 72-54 half-time lead against a Lakers defense regarded as one of the best in the league.Although Los Angeles managed to get their offense moving in the third quarter, outscoring Denver 38-34, the Nuggets continued to test the Lakers' defense.Jokic completed his sixth triple-double of the playoffs midway through the third quarter and then electrified the home crowd with a 31-foot three-pointer on the buzzer to put the Nuggets ahead 106-92 heading into the final quarter.The Lakers came surging back in the fourth quarter when a Reaves three-pointer trimmed the Denver lead to eight points with just over 10 minutes remaining.The Nuggets responded with four unanswered points from Murray to help Denver take a 14-point lead with just over seven minutes left on the clock.But again the Lakers responded and two quick threes from Reaves helped the visitors make it a three-point game after a 9-0 run.The Nuggets held on however and a late Jokic free throw sealed the win.James took scant consolation from the Lakers' fourth-quarter fightback.\"In postseason it doesn't matter if you cut it to one or you're down 20, if you lose, you lose,\" James said. \"They are 1-0 and we have to come back with desperation going into game two. We have to play better, we have to rebound better ... We need to be better in all facets of the game.\"Game two in the series takes place in Denver on Thursday. The winner of the series will face either Boston or Miami in the NBA finals next month."

    "articleBody": "The Los Angeles Lakers punched their ticket to the NBA Western Conference semi-finals in emphatic style Friday, mauling the Memphis Grizzlies 125-85 to win their first-round series 4-2.LeBron James and the Lakers will have to wait to see who they'll face in the Western Conference semi-finals after the Sacramento Kings fended off elimination, beating the NBA champion Golden State Warriors 118-99 to force a game seven in their series.The Lakers, who earned the Western Conference seventh seed via the play-in tournament, rebounded with a vengeance after failing to lock up the series in Memphis on Wednesday.They dominated in every facet in one of their best performances of an often rocky season, thrilling a crowd at Crypto.com Arena that included 86-year-old Oscar-winning actor Jack Nicholson.Nicholson, a Lakers fan for decades, was in his courtside seat for the first time since last season's opener in October 2021.D'Angelo Russell led the Lakers with 31 points. James finished with 22 points and six assists, and Anthony Davis had 16 points and 14 rebounds.After they \"let one go\" in Memphis, Davis said, the Lakers weren't about to miss another chance on their home floor.\"We came out with energy,\" Davis told ESPN in an on-court interview. \"Our crowd was into it. We came out with a sense of urgency that we're not going to let them guys come in here and force a game seven.\"We just came out with that mindset of ending it today.\"The Lakers dominated every facet. They outscored the Grizzlies 52-32 in the paint and 24-14 on the fast break.They out-rebounded the Grizzlies 52-45 and had 20 second-chance points to Memphis' nine.They held Morant to 10 points on three-of-16 shooting, with Santi Aldama leading the Grizzlies with 16 points off the bench.Grizzlies guard Desmond Bane added 15.The Lakers won a playoff series for the first time since winning the club's 17th NBA title in 2020, in the Covid-protective bubble in Florida.They fell to Phoenix in the first round in 2021 and didn't make it to the playoffs last season. They hadn't won a playoff series outside the bubble since 2012.It was a far different story for the home team in San Francisco, where the Kings rebounded from three straight defeats with a comprehensive victory that knotted their series with the Warriors at three games apiece. - Force and energy - \"I thought the Kings were the aggressor from the start, putting a lot of pressure on us defensively,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr admitted. \"We just never got into our game, but I give Sacramento credit for that.\"They came out with more force and more energy. The right team won tonight, that's for sure. Now we've got to regroup and get ready for game seven.\"The Kings were undaunted by the knowledge that the Warriors were 33-8 at home in the regular season, and had won two home games to claw back into this series after dropping the first two games in Sacramento.They seized a quick 8-0 lead to set an early tone and after a string of lead changes pushed the advantage to double digits in the second quarter.Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and the rest of the star-studded Warriors couldn't get the deficit below five points the rest of the way.Malik Monk scored 28 off the bench and point guard De'Aaron Fox added 26 for the Kings, who are back in the playoffs for the first time since 2006 and have a chance to take the series on Sunday.\"We wanted to hit first, hit second, and hit last, and I think we did a good job of that tonight,\" said Fox, who again excelled despite playing with a broken left index finger.Rookie Keegan Murray scored 15 points and pulled down 12 rebounds for Sacramento. Kevin Huerter and Trey Lyles added 12 apiece as the Kings withstood every Warriors attempt to rally.Center Domantas Sabonis finished with seven points and 11 rebounds before fouling out with five minutes remaining -- sporting a black eye from taking an elbow on a jump ball in the second period.Curry led the Warriors with 29 points and five assists, and Thompson added 22, but they got little support.Andrew Wiggins chipped in 13 for Golden State, but Kevon Looney and Jordan Poole had just seven apiece and the Kings' bench outscored Golden State's reserves 52-21."

Tonight I think we matched their physicality and it showed.\"Young led a superb all-round offensive team effort from Atlanta, who saw seven players finish in double figures.Dejounte Murray posted 18 points, while Saddiq Bey added 17.Atlanta took a stranglehold on the game after a dominant first-half display, outhustling a sluggish Miami line-up at both ends of the court to quickly open up a double-digit lead.The Hawks moved nine points clear at the end of the first quarter at 36-27 and then accelerated away in the second to lead by 24 points at 63-39.Only a late 11-0 Miami run to close the half -– Kyle Lowry taking his first-half tally to 19 points -- kept the scoreline respectable but Atlanta nevertheless still reached half-time with a hefty 65-50 lead.Young led the Atlanta scoring in the first half with 13 points and six assists, including one superb behind-the-back pass in the second quarter to set up a three-pointer for Bey.Clint Capela also delivered a huge defensive performance for Atlanta, hauling in 21 rebounds and making two crucial blocks in the first half to stymie Miami's offense.Miami rallied to start the second half with a 13-4 run and closed to within five points at one stage in the third quarter.But Atlanta were always able to raise the game at key moments to close out the win."

You can't give this team any life. Once they get going, once this building gets going, it's tough to stop them.\" - Wizards shock Celtics - Elsewhere, the Boston Celtics' chances of overtaking the Milwaukee Bucks for the top seed in the East took a hit with an ugly 130-111 loss to the lowly Washington Wizards.Perhaps caught looking ahead to a Thursday clash with the Bucks, the Celtics were lackadaisical on defense, unable to stop a Wizards team missing two key players in Bradley Beal and Kyle Kuzma.Kristaps Porzingis scored 32 points for the Wizards and Deni Avdija added 25.Jayson Tatum returned from a one-game absence to lead the Celtics with 28 points. Marcus Smart had four three-pointers in the first half, but overall, Boston connected on just 11 of 44 from three-point range.They trailed by 13 at halftime and by as many as 23 in the second half.\"It was just one of those nights,\" Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \"Very rarely has that happened to our team. Just one of those off nights.\"The Toronto Raptors outscored the Miami Heat 62-36 in the paint in a 106-92 victory.Pascal Siakam scored 26 points and Scottie Barnes added 22 along with a career-high 12 assists for the Raptors -- as the Heat failed to gain ground in their bid to avoid the play-in round.With Jimmy Butler sidelined by a sore neck, the Heat dropped a second straight game.Tyler Herro scored 33 points and Bam Adebayo added 21 points and 12 rebounds for Miami, who cut the deficit to 10 with less than four minutes to play only for their charge to stall.Dejounte Murray starred late as the Atlanta Hawks edged the playoff-bound Cleveland Cavaliers 120-118.Murray made three free throws to put the Hawks up 115-113 with 2:14 remaining, then came up with a steal and a basket that pushed the lead to four in the final minute.He finished with 29 points to lead the Hawks, who remained tied with Toronto for the eighth-best record in the East.Atlanta withstood a 44-point effort from Donovan Mitchell, who tied LeBron James's Cavaliers franchise record of 10 games of 40 or more points in a season."

Now we have to let that game go and try and win a ball game in Miami.\"A lot of times in defeat you learn who the hell you are -- so this is an opportunity for us to learn who we are.\"Brooklyn looked poised to end that losing streak after moving 10 points clear midway through the fourth.But Evan Mobley and Donovan Mitchell combined for 13 fourth quarter points to spark the Cavaliers fightback.Mitchell finished with 31 points to lead the Cavs scoring, while Mobley weighed in with 26 points, 16 rebounds and three assists.Four other Cleveland players finished in double figures.Mikal Bridges led the Brooklyn scoring with 32 points while Spencer Dinwiddie added 25 with 12 assists and four rebounds.In other games in the NBA on Wednesday, the fifth-placed New York Knicks slid to their third straight loss in a 111-106 reverse to the Orlando Magic in Florida.Orlando, who are 13th in the Eastern Conference with a 31-43 record, kept their faint postseason hopes alive after 21 points from rookie star Paolo Banchero.Immanuel Quickley and Quentin Grimes led the Knicks scorers with 25 points apiece, with Julius Randle adding 23.Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau said his team's erratic display, which saw them twice trail by 19 points in the second and third quarters, had ulimately proved to be his team's undoing.\"We exerted so much energy trying to fight out of that hole that we fell short in the end,\" Thibodeau said.\"Right now our team is just out of sorts. You have to pull together when you go through rough times -- you get into things together, you get out of things together.\"We have to do everything a lot better.\""

    "articleBody": "Giannis Antetokounmpo bagged a triple-double and Brook Lopez delivered a huge fourth quarter as the Milwaukee Bucks returned to winning ways with a 118-111 victory over the Toronto Raptors on Sunday.The Eastern Conference leaders, jolted by a lopsided loss to Indiana on Thursday, returned to form with a dogged come-from-behind win over the Raptors at Milwaukee's Fiserv Forum.Toronto led by eight near the end of the third quarter, but were overpowered down the stretch with Lopez scoring 17 of his 26 points in the final period to drag Milwaukee over the line.Antetokounmpo meanwhile finished with 22 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists as Milwaukee improved to 51-20 at the top of the Eastern Conference, 2.5 games clear of the in-form Philadelphia 76ers.Fred VanVleet led Toronto's scorers with 23 points.In other games on Sunday, Austin Reaves scored a career-high 35 points as the Los Angeles Lakers bounced back from Friday's agonizing loss to Dallas to see off Orlando 111-105.The Lakers, battling to remain in the hunt for a postseason berth in the Western Conference, were left shell-shocked after a buzzer-beating loss to the Mavs on Friday.It looked as if history might repeat itself on Sunday as the Magic closed to 101-101 with 2 minutes and 39 seconds remaining.But Reaves took over by rattling in his team's final 10 points to secure a win which lifted the Lakers into the play-in positions.\"It's a good win,\" Reaves said afterward. \"Every win from now is crucial, and every game from now is crucial.\"It's all about how we approach the game -- if we're locked in to what we need to do I feel like we've got the firepower to be one of the best teams in the league.\" - Blazers struggling - In Portland, the Trail Blazers' playoff push suffered a blow with a 117-102 defeat to the Los Angeles Clippers.The Clippers never trailed throughout, with Paul George finishing with 29 points and Kawhi Leonard with 24 points.The loss leaves Portland in 13th place in the Western Conference with a 31-40 record, three spots outside the play-in places.Elsewhere Sunday, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 40 points as the Oklahoma City Thunder staged a second-half rally to eclipse Devin Booker and the Phoenix Suns.Gilgeous-Alexander shot 12-of-24 from the field while draining 16-of-19 free throws as Oklahoma City overturned a 15-point first-half deficit to complete a 124-120 victory.The Thunder trailed by 10 points early in the fourth quarter but outscored Phoenix 34-24 in the final frame –- with Gilgeous-Alexander contributing 10 points –- to grab victory.The win boosts Oklahoma City's playoff hopes, with the Thunder improving to 35-36 in the Western Conference for eighth place.Only a handful of games separate a swath of teams jostling for the postseason in the West, where Phoenix remain in fourth place with a 38-33 record.Phoenix, meanwhile, were sparked by 46 points from Booker but saw only three other players break into double figures after a steely OKC defensive display in the second half.\"It was a total team effort,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said afterward. \"There was some adversity throughout the game, but we just kept pushing and stuck to our gameplan and came up with the 'W'.\"In other games on Sunday, Nikola Jokic's 28th triple-double of the season helped the Denver Nuggets take a 108-102 win on the road against the Brooklyn Nets.Two-time NBA Most Valuable Player Jokic finished with 22 points, 17 rebounds and 10 assists as the Western Conference leaders improved to  48-24. The Nuggets have already assured themselves of a postseason berth and are now aiming to lock down top seed in the final three weeks of the regular season.Michael Porter Jr. led the Denver scorers with 28 points, while Jamal Murray added 25.In San Antonio, Keldon Johnson and Devin Vassell both finished with 29 points as the Spurs fought back from 24 points down to stun the visiting Atlanta Hawks 126-118.The Hawks looked to be romping to a comfortable road win after piling on 83 first-half points to lead by 22 at half time.But the Spurs -- already eliminated from postseason contention -- flipped the script after the break, outscoring Atlanta 39-20 in the third before a 26-15 fourth quarter."

And I think it has been a long time since we won an overtime game. So all those things -- dig deep and figure out a way to get it done.\"Curry, who turns 35 on Tuesday, scored nine points in overtime to seal the victory, playing 43 minutes in all to achieve his first victory in four tries since returning March 5 from a left leg injury.\"I'm great. I'm just getting old,\" a visibly worn-down Curry said after the finish. \"Everybody contributed and that's the way it has to be for us the way we're built right now.\"Curry made eight of 11 shots from the floor in the fourth quarter and overtime, and sank four of seven from behind the arc.\"That's a great way to get a win,\" Curry said.In Atlanta, Jason Tatum delivered game highs of 34 points and 15 rebounds in powering the Boston Celtics over the host Hawks 134-125.Jaylen Brown added 24 points as the Celtics improved to 47-21, while the Hawks, paced by 35 points and 13 assists from Trae Young, fell to 34-34. - Kawhi sparks Clippers - Kawhi Leonard scored 38 points to lead the Los Angeles Clippers over the visiting New York Knicks 106-95.Paul George added 22 points, eight rebounds and eight assists for the Clippers.

    "articleBody": "The Grizzlies erupted for 48 points in the first period to take a stranglehold on the contest as Golden State's suspect defense was exposed once more.Tyus Jones led the Memphis scorers with 22 points while Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson Jr. had 21 points apiece as six Grizzlies players finished in double figures.The emphatic victory was a welcome piece of good news for Memphis after a challenging week. The Grizzlies were once again without the services of star point guard Ja Morant, who is under investigation by the NBA for posting a video on social media of himself waving a handgun in a strip club.The win also gave Memphis bragging rights over a Golden State team with whom they have developed an increasingly fractious rivalry in recent seasons. The Warriors beat the Grizzlies in the Western Conference playoffs last season en route to the NBA title, and the build-up to Thursday's game had been marked by a war of words between Memphis' Dillon Brooks and Golden State's Draymond Green.The bad blood threatened to spill into Thursday's clash, with the two men getting into a tense confrontation in the second quarter which ended with them being separated by a referee.Warriors coach Steve Kerr was left lamenting the first-quarter tactical gamble of starting four guards that saw his team routed.Elsewhere on Thursday, the Milwaukee Bucks overcame the absence of Giannis Antetokounmpo to extend their lead at the top of the Eastern Conference with a 118-113 win over Brooklyn.Bobby Portis led the Bucks scorers with 28 points while Brook Lopez added 24 and Grayson Allen 19.The Bucks jumped out to a 22-point lead early in the second quarter but Brooklyn chipped away and got within two points with less than a minute remaining. Milwaukee held on for victory and now lead the East by 2.5 games from the Boston Celtics with a 48-18 record."

    "articleBody": "The Bulls, who are languishing just outside the play-in places in 11th place in the Eastern Conference, took control with a 36-point third quarter to upset the runaway Western Conference leaders.The Nuggets have been near-invincible in Denver this season, with a league-best 30-4 home record and were unbeaten in eight at their Ball Arena fortress before Wednesday.But a gutsy Chicago performance ended with Denver on the wrong end of a rare blowout as Lavine finished with 29 points from 12-of-18 shooting and Nikola Vucevic added 25 points with 14 rebounds.Denver's reigning NBA Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic was held to 18 points.In other games, Phoenix shrugged off the late injury absence of Kevin Durant -- who had been due to make his home debut -- to trounce the Oklahoma City Thunder 132-101.Suns fans had been eager to get their first glimpse of Durant at their home venue since his blockbuster trade from Brooklyn last month.But the 34-year-old superstar was ruled out shortly before tip-off after rolling an ankle as he attempted a layup during the warm-up.\n                  \nCeltics bounce back                 \n                  \nIn Durant's absence, Devin Booker took center stage for Phoenix, erupting for 44 points with Terrence Ross adding 24 from the bench and Chris Paul chipping in with 18.Phoenix coach Monty Williams said Durant had suffered an ankle sprain.In Boston, Jayson Tatum scored 30 points as the Celtics snapped their three-game losing streak with a 115-93 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers.Tatum spearheaded a superb all-round offensive effort for the Celtics, who had suffered a string of collapses during their recent mini-slump which included defeats to Cleveland, the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets.But there was little sign of Boston's problems persisting against Portland as the Celtics got back into the winning groove in decisive fashion.Boston, who were knocked out of first place in the Eastern Conference last week, led from early in the first quarter and never looked back, surging 27 points clear in the fourth before wrapping up an encouraging win.All of Boston's starters finished in double figures with Tatum's 30-point haul leading the way while Derrick White added 21 points.Al Horford finished with 17, Jaylen Brown added 11 and Marcus Smart 10.At the other end, Boston's defense restricted Damian Lillard to 27 points while only two other Portland starters broke single digits.\n                  \n'On right track'               \n                  \nTatum was satisfied Boston had managed to keep Portland at arm's length following recent defeats where they blew big leads.Boston now depart for a six-game road trip where they will look to build on Wednesday's win. \"We've got to get back on the right track,\" Tatum said. Cleveland held off a late rally on the road in Miami to extend their recent winning streak to three games.The Cavaliers, who are fourth in the Eastern Conference standings with a 42-26 record, completed a 104-100 win thanks to 25 points from Darius Garland and 18 from Donovan Mitchell.Jimmy Butler led Miami's scorers with 28 points while Tyler Herro had 22 for the Heat, who are seventh in the East.In New Orleans, a flurry of late scoring from C.J. McCollum led the Pelicans to a 113-106 victory over the Dallas Mavericks as Luka Doncic was held to just 15 points.McCollum finished with 32 points -- 13 of them coming in the final four minutes of the game -- as the Pels claimed a deserved win."

    "articleBody": "The Milwaukee Bucks shrugged off the injury absence of Giannis Antetokounmpo to tighten their grip on top spot in the Eastern Conference on Tuesday with a 134-123 defeat of the Orlando Magic.The Bucks moved 2.5 games clear of the Boston Celtics at the top of the standings with a clinical offensive display that saw Brook Lopez, Khris Middleton and Jevon Carter share the scoring around.Lopez finished with 26 points after shooting 64.3 percent from the field while Middleton and Carter both chipped in with 24 points apiece for Milwaukee.Bobby Portis, Jae Crowder, and Joe Ingles also finished in double digits for the Bucks, who have now won nine straight games on the road.Milwaukee -- who saw their 16-game unbeaten streak snapped by Philadelphia on Saturday -- improved to 47-18 at the top of the Eastern Conference. The Celtics are 45-21.The Bucks were always in control against Orlando on Tuesday, leading from the end of the first quarter onwards and maintaining a comfortable double-digit lead for most of the fourth quarter.Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer singled out Lopez for praise following the win.\"We tend to talk about his defense so much but offensively he's been really good -- it was great to get him going early,\" Budenholzer said.\"It's good to see him scoring in a variety of ways... we're fortunate for all the different things he can do.\" - Embiid rolls on - In Minneapolis, the Philadelphia 76ers rolled to a third straight victory with a 117-94 blowout over the Timberwolves.Joel Embiid came within a whisker of a second consecutive 40-point game after his 42 points against Indiana on Monday, delivering 39 points against a Minnesota team who struggled offensively.Embiid shot 13-of-22 from the field, with a perfect 4-from-4 from three-point range and nine-from-nine from the free-throw line.With James Harden rested, Tyrese Maxey once again provided offensive support with 27 points while Tobias Harris (10) and De'Anthony Melton (11) also made double figures.Minnesota's challenge was led by Anthony Edwards with 32 points but no other starter for the Wolves had more than seven points. The Sixers improved to 43-22 to remain in third place in the Eastern Conference.\"I just want to do whatever it takes to win games,\" Embiid said afterwards.\"Tonight without James (Harden) I wanted to be as aggressive as possible to make sure we got the win. We played really good defense and offensively we moved the ball and made shots.\"It doesn't matter who I play -- I just feel like I'm going to do my thing regardless.\"Embiid brushed off suggestions that his form should put him amongst the favorites for the NBA's Most Valuable Player award after several near-misses in recent seasons.\"This year I'm taking a different approach -- just trying to focus on the right things, win games, dominate and whatever happens, happens,\" Embiid said. - Hornets sting Knicks - The New York Knicks' nine-game winning streak came to an abrupt end at Madison Square Garden with a 112-105 defeat to the lowly Charlotte Hornets.Charlotte -- second from bottom in the East -- looked to be sliding towards their 47th defeat of the season as New York pulled into a 16-point lead early in the second half.But Charlotte came alive with a 37-point third quarter and then outscored the Knicks 25-16 in the final frame to snatch victory.Kelly Oubre Jr. had 27 points, Terry Rozier had 25 and Gordon Hayward had 23 for Charlotte.The Knicks showed visible signs of weariness as they returned home after a grueling sequence of road wins over Miami and Boston.Elsewhere Tuesday, Stephen Curry poured in 40 points for Golden State in only his second game since returning from injury but could not prevent the NBA champions from slipping to a 137-128 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder scoring with 33 points, with all of Oklahoma City's starters making double figures.In Los Angeles, Anthony Davis finished with 30 points and 22 rebounds to help the Lakers to a 112-103 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies, who were without the suspended Ja Morant for a second straight game.The win moves the Lakers into ninth place in the Western Conference standings on 32-34."

    "articleBody": "Kevin Durant produced a 37-point masterpiece as the Phoenix Suns defeated the Dallas Mavericks while Steph Curry's return from injury was not enough to prevent Golden State falling to the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA on Sunday.In the Eastern Conference, the New York Knicks made it nine straight wins with a thrilling victory in double overtime against the second-placed Boston Celtics.A packed slate of NBA games featured two heavyweight fixtures in the Western Conference, with Durant going up against former Brooklyn team-mate Kyrie Irving as the Suns traveled to Dallas, where they claimed a nail-biting 130-126 victory.In Los Angeles, Curry's return was a further boost to the in-form Warriors but it was the Lakers who claimed a precious 113-105 win to keep their playoff hopes on track.Phoenix's clash with Dallas lived up to the hype, with 13 lead changes in a contest that went down to the wire.Durant, traded to Phoenix in a blockbuster move from the Nets last month, delivered a signature clutch performance to guide the Suns to victory.The 34-year-old scored the go-ahead basket with less than 12 seconds remaining before adding two late free throws to ice the game.Durant received support from Devin Booker, who added 36 points, 10 assists and five rebounds, while Chris Paul added 11 points.\"We dug down deep,\" Durant said. \"Just tried to do my best and finish the shot. Guys were moving the ball all night -- it was a good win.\"Durant said he had not been distracted by playing against former Nets team-mate Irving.\"I've played more of my career against him than with him so it didn't feel any different,\" Durant said. \"We just want to keep building.\"Dallas star Luka Doncic finished with 34 points, with Irving contributing 30 points and Tim Hardaway Jr. adding 21 off the bench. - Davis leads Lakers - Tempers flared in the dying seconds with Doncic and Booker going nose-to-nose after the Slovenian squandered a relatively straightforward chance to tie the game with six seconds remaining.Doncic confronted Booker after the Phoenix star appeared to taunt the Dallas talisman, triggering a confrontation between players from both teams.\"It's a competitive game. It's all good,\" Doncic said of his spat with Booker.\"Next time, just don't wait until there's three seconds left to talk.\"Booker laughed off the verbal dust-up.\"It was just two competitors going at it,\" he said afterwards. \"I've no problem with Luka on or off the court -- but when we're competing, we're competing.\"Phoenix improved to 36-29 to stay in fourth spot in the West while Dallas fell to 33-32. The Mavs are in seventh, just outside the automatic postseason places.In Los Angeles, Anthony Davis once again came up big for the Lakers in the absence of the injured LeBron James to help secure victory over the Warriors.Davis finished with 39 points, eight rebounds and six assists as six Lakers players finished in double figures.The Lakers sprinted into a 20-point lead in the first quarter and then held off a second-half rally from the NBA champions.The returning Curry led the Golden State scoring with 27 points while Klay Thompson added 22.The Warriors fell to 34-31 with the loss and are fifth in the Western Conference. The Lakers improved to 31-34, and are just outside the play-in places.The Knicks were without star point guard Jalen Brunson for the trip to Boston but his replacement Immanuel Quickley put up a career-high 38 points in a 131-129 win after double overtime.The Knicks went on a 21-2 run at the end of the third and into the fourth quarter but Boston, who trailed by seven with 1:25 left in the game, were able to take the contest into overtime.With the last play of the game, Al Horford had a chance to win it for Boston but his three-point attempt from the corner bounced out off the rim.Jayson Tatum top-scored for Boston with 40 points while RJ Barrett had 29 points and Julius Randle scored 30 for the on-fire Knicks.Eastern Conference leaders the Milwaukee Bucks bounced back from their loss to the Philadelphia 76ers, beating the Washington Wizards 117-111.Giannis Antetokounmpo claimed his fourth triple double of the campaign with 23 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds."

We support his prioritization of his well-being,\" the company said.But pundits were less forgiving.\"Ja Morant’s fault is his own, and I’m proud of him for owning it. But he needs to get it together,\" said ESPN's Stephen A Smith.\"It doesn’t matter where Ja Morant is from or how he grew up, he’s making truly catastrophic decisions,\" tweeted journalist Jemele Hill.The incident comes just days after U.S. media reported that Morant had been accused in police reports last year of punching a 17-year-old.No criminal charges were filed against Morant in the incident, which took place during a pickup basketball game at Morant's Tennessee house in July 2022. Morant's agent said he had been acting in self-defense.In police records obtained by the Washington Post , the unnamed teenaged boy accused Morant of punching him \"12-13 times\" during a pickup basketball game at Morant's Tennessee house in July 2022.In interviews with police the teen said that after their altercation Morant went into his house and \"re-emerged with a gun visible in the waistband of his pants.\"Morant told police he \"swung first\" but felt he was acting in self-defense after the teenager threw a basketball that hit him in the head, later making a comment that Morant found threatening.\"Any of the dozens of witnesses will confirm Ja acted in self-defense and that he did not have a firearm,\" said Morant's agent Jim Tanner.Days before that incident, the head of security at a Memphis mall told police he felt \"threatened\" by Morant and a group of his associates after an incident in the shopping center's parking lot.Morant was in the headlines again in early February, when the NBA investigated allegations by the Indiana Pacers that the player's entourage \"aggressively confronted\" members of their traveling party, possibly pointing a red laser at them."

    "articleBody": "The Brooklyn Nets stunned the Boston Celtics 115-105 on Friday, rallying from a 28-point deficit to beat the Eastern Conference contenders on their home floor in the biggest comeback win of the NBA season.Mikal Bridges scored 38 points and grabbed 10 rebounds and Cameron Johnson, celebrating his 27th birthday, added 20 points for Brooklyn, who have struggled since the February trade departures of stars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant.They'd lost four straight and looked headed for another lopsided defeat when the Celtics took a 51-23 lead with 7:23 left in the second quarter.\"We just kept fighting, we got stops and that was the biggest thing,\" said Bridges, who arrived in the trade that sent Durant to the Phoenix Suns. \"It all started with our defense.\"The Nets had whittled the deficit to nine points at halftime and took the lead for the first time -- and for good -- with 6:11 left in the third quarter.The win marked the biggest comeback of the season, eclipsing the Lakers' fightback from a 27-point deficit in a victory over Dallas.Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 35 points. Jayson Tatum, celebrating his 25th birthday, added 22 points with 13 rebounds but the Celtics have lost two of their last three and slipped a bit further behind the Milwaukee Bucks atop the East.\"We got off to a really good start playing the right way and we just took the foot off the gas and it cost us,\" said Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla.In Denver, two-time reigning Most Valuable Player Nikola Jokic scored 18 points with 18 rebounds and 10 assists, his 25th triple-double of the season pushing the Nuggets to a 113-97 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies in a battle of the top two teams in the West.The Nuggets, who are a perfect 25-0 this season when Jokic posts a triple-double, pushed their lead atop the standings to six games. - 'Amazing' Jokic - Michael Porter Jr. scored 26 points and Jamal Murray netted 11 of his 22 in the fourth quarter as the Nuggets pulled away after going into the final period tied.\"I just got aggressive,\" said Murray, who is enjoying his ringside seat to Jokic's incredible season.\"He loves to pass and make the right reads and get us going. He's been doing it all season. It's amazing to see every night. You don't know what to say about him because he just keeps doing it.\"Ja Morant, wearing a protective mask after suffering a nasal fracture at Houston on Wednesday, scored 27 points and handed out 10 assists for Memphis.In Miami, Julius Randle scored 43 points, draining the game-winning three-pointer with 1.7 seconds remaining to lift the New York Knicks to an eighth straight win, 122-120 over the Heat.Jalen Brunson added 25 points for the surging Knicks.Jimmy Butler scored 33 points for Miami and Tyler Herro added 29. Herro's layup put the Heat ahead by one with 23.1 seconds left to play.Randle responded, coming up with the game-winner after nearly having the ball poked away by Butler.Golden State, still awaiting the return of injured star Stephen Curry, posted a fifth straight win, 108-99 over the New Orleans Pelicans in San Francisco.Klay Thompson scored 27 points and Jonathan Kuminga added 19 off the bench as the reigning champions rallied from an early 17-point deficit.The Sacramento Kings held off the Los Angeles Clippers 128-127 -- a week after they came out on top in a 176-175 double-overtime thriller against the Clippers.The Kings, led by 33 points from De'Aaron Fox, were a perfect 26 for 26 from the free-throw line.In Chicago, Devin Booker drilled six three-pointers on the way to 35 points to lead the Phoenix Suns to a 125-104 victory over the Bulls.Durant, playing his second game for Phoenix, scored 20 points to help his team withstand a 31-point performance from Chicago's DeMar DeRozan."

    "articleBody": "Ja Morant produced a second-half scoring spree as the Memphis Grizzlies exploited the absence of LeBron James to beat the Los Angeles Lakers 121-109 on Tuesday.After being restricted to six points as the Lakers took a 49-46 lead into the break, Grizzlies star Morant erupted with 28 points in the third quarter to tip the contest decisively in Memphis' favor.The Memphis win snapped the Lakers' three-game winning streak and put another dent in the team's recent resurgence following the injury to James on Sunday.James, who is reportedly facing multiple weeks on the sidelines after injuring his right foot in a Lakers victory over Dallas, was seen wearing a protective boot on the sidelines on Tuesday as his depleted team-mates slipped to defeat.The Lakers were also without the injured D'Angelo Russell, and the absence of the team's two most assured ball-handlers was keenly felt, with the Lakers coughing up 26 turnovers for 41 points.Morant received scoring support from Xavier Tillman with 18 points, while Jaren Jackson Jr. and Desmond Bane added 16 points apiece for the home side.Morant said he had been determined to produce a big second half after a wayward first-half shooting performance.\"I was locked in,\" Morant said. \"The shots I missed early in that first half were the shots that I made in that third quarter.\"I told my team-mates at half-time I wasn't going to miss too many more of those. I got it going, and the rest is history.\"Anthony Davis led the Lakers scoring with 28 points while Lonnie Walker IV added 21 off the bench.\"We've got some guys out of the lineup obviously but we have capable players, and we have to be conscious of making the simple play,\" Lakers coach Darvin Ham said.\"You turn the ball over, it's hard to get your defense set.\" - Bucks rally, Jokic century - Elsewhere, Giannis Antetokounmpo scored 33 points as the Milwaukee Bucks stretched their winning streak to 15 games with a come-from-behind 118-104 victory over the Brooklyn Nets.The Nets, who are rebuilding after the departures of Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant, sprinted into a 28-13 first-quarter lead and remained in front for the remainder of the half to lead by 10 points at the break.But a third-quarter scoring blitz from Milwaukee -– outscoring Brooklyn by 39-23 -– saw the Eastern Conference leaders finally edge clear 91-85 heading into the fourth quarter before closing out the win.\"Right now we're playing great basketball, we're playing together and guys are making shots and defending,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"We're out there competing, doing whatever it takes to win, building good habits. It's fun.\"Antetokounmpo said the Bucks' unflappable temperament had helped them recover from their double-digit half-time deficit.\"When we're winning and making shots, it's easy,\" Antetokounmpo said after a win that saw the Bucks improve to 44-17.\"But sometimes when you're down it's a little harder. But at the end of the day, as a team we kept our composure.\"We know we have to be able to win games like this.\"In Houston, Nikola Jokic brought up a century of triple-doubles as the Western Conference-leading Denver Nuggets downed the Rockets 133-112.Nuggets star Jokic, the two-time reigning NBA Most Valuable Player, finished with 14 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists.The Serbian star is only the sixth player in NBA history to collect 100 or more triple-doubles, joining Russell Westbrook (198), Oscar Robertson (181), Magic Johnson (138), Jason Kidd (107) and LeBron James (106).In San Francisco, Damian Lillard finished with 25 points following his 71-point masterpiece on Sunday but was unable to stop the Golden State Warriors, who cruised to a 123-105 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers.Jordan Poole led the Golden State scoring with 29 points while Klay Thompson added 23."

    "articleBody": "Jayson Tatum scored an All-Star record 55 points and Team Giannis Antetokounmpo defeated Team LeBron James 184-175 to win Sunday's 72nd NBA All-Star Game, the first loss for James in six times as captain.Both namesake captains made early exits with injuries, James after bruising his right hand on the rim making a dunk and Greek star Antetokounmpo with a right wrist sprain suffered three nights earlier.That left the starring roles up for grabs and the All-Star Game Most Valuable Player award went to Boston star Tatum, who broke the old NBA All-Star Game record of 52 points scored by Anthony Davis in 2017.\"It means the world,\" Tatum said. \"You think of all the legends and great players that have played this game.\"Records are made to be broken so I'll hold it for as long as I can but I'm certain somebody will come along in a couple years and try to break it.\"Tatum made 22-of-31 shots from the floor, 10-of-18 from 3-point range and added 10 rebounds, six assists, a steal and a blocked shot.Tatum scored a record 27 points in the third quarter to lift Team Giannis ahead  158-141 entering the fourth quarter.\"You see the first three go in and keep shooting, just stay hot and just keep running,\" Tatum said.A unique rule featured an untimed final quarter with a \"target score\" set to decide a winner -- the total for the team leading after three quarters plus 24 points.Whichever club reached that number first won, setting a goal for both teams of 182 points.Tatum sank a free throw to reach 53 and break the record, giving Team Giannis a 177-162 lead.Tatum added a layup to put his club a single point from victory at 181-170 and moments later Damian Lillard sank a final 3-pointer to deliver the victory.Giannis had been 0-2 as a captain but was delighted to hoist the trophy despite a sore wrist.\"Winner. Winner. Chicken dinner,\" Antetokounmpo said.Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell added 40 points and 10 assists for Team Giannis while Portland's Lillard had 26 off the bench.Team LeBron reserve Jaylen Brown of Boston had a team-high 35 points plus 14 rebounds. Philadelphia's Joel Embiid and Kyrie Irving of Dallas each added 32 points, with Irving adding a game-high 15 assists.Four-time NBA champion and NBA Most Valuable Player James set a record by playing in his 19th All-Star Game but suffered a bruised right hand hitting the rim while making a dunk and sat out the second half.The 38-year-old Los Angeles Lakers superstar finished with 13 points on 6-of-11 shooting with four assists and a rebound. He was able to manage numerous handshakes in a half-time ceremony in tribute to his scoring mark.Milwaukee big man Antetokounmpo made a dunk for the game's first points before leaving for good seconds later due to a sprained right wrist suffered in a regular-season game on Thursday.\"It's just hard. I love competing,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I wasn't able to participate for the full thing but I wanted to go out there even for 10 seconds, sweat a little bit in the jersey, because I want to be part of this.\" - Lillard's half-court 3 - Team Giannis led 99-92 at halftime with Tatum scoring 17 points and Irving leading Team LeBron with 18.Lillard, the 3-Point Contest winner, sank a 3-pointer from just beyond the half-court line to highlight a third quarter dominated by deadly NBA sharpshooters.James fell to 5-1 as an All-Star captain since the format began in 2018, having won twice over Kevin Durant and Antetokounmpo and once over Stephen Curry.Miluwakee big man Antetokounmpo from Greece and Los Angeles Lakers playmaker James, who earlier this month became the NBA's all-time scoring leader, were named captains after being the top vote-getters for All-Star starting spots from the Eastern and Western Conferences.Captains picked their rosters only minutes before tipoff.James selected Cameroonian big man Enbiid with his first pick while Antetokounmpo selected Tatum next.js/dw© Agence France-Presse"

    "articleBody": "Brown took an accidental elbow from teammate Jayson Tatum as they both went for a rebound with less than two minutes left in the first half and was knocked out of the game with a facial contusion.It was a potentially crushing blow for a Celtics team already without Marcus Smart, Robert Williams and Al Horford, but the Eastern Conference leaders didn't miss a beat.\"Tonight was the definition of a team win,\" Tatum told broadcaster ESPN after the Celtics shot 52.6 percent from the floor, draining 19 of their 35 three-point attempts.Tatum himself had a quiet night with just 12 points, eight rebounds and nine assists, connecting on just five of his 15 shots from the field.But his unheralded teammates did more than enough to hold off the Sixers and their MVP candidate Joel Embiid, who led all scorers with 28 points.James Harden scored 20 for Philadelphia, who never led after the first quarter.Down by 11 with 5:51 to play, the 76ers would twice cut the deficit to three, but the Celtics found the answers.Derrick White and Malcolm Brogdon scored 19 apiece for Boston. Blake Griffin drained five three-pointers while Sam Hauser and Grant Williams hit four apiece.\"Those guys are putting in so much work,\" Tatum said of the players who stepped up. \"And they're professionals. When they get their number called they come in and compete.\"The Cleveland Cavaliers also shook off notable absences in a wire-to-wire 113-85 home victory over the Detroit Pistons.Jarrett Allen scored 20 points, Evan Mobley added 19 to lead the Cavs, who were without All-Star starter Donovan Mitchell and Darius Garland, Mitchell sitting out to rest a nagging groin injury and Garland out with a troublesome thumb.The Cavs led by 18 after the first quarter on the way to a fourth straight victory.The Pistons sliced the deficit to two points in the third quarter, but Cleveland outscored Detroit 37-17 in the final period as the Pistons were held to their lowest points total of the season.\n                  \nKings edge Rockets                 \n                  \nThe Sacramento Kings edged the Rockets 130-128 in Houston, where De'Aaron Fox made three free throws with three-tenths of a second left to seal it after Eric Gordon was charged with a debatable shooting foul.Fox scored 13 of his 31 points in the fourth quarter as the Kings withstood 41 points from Houston's Jalen Green to win a tight back-and-forth battle that featured 22 lead changes.In Toronto, Pascal Siakam scored 37 points and pulled down 10 rebounds to lead the Raptors to a third straight victory, 112-98 over the reeling San Antonio Spurs.Siakam notched his fourth 30-point double-double of the season and 22nd of his career. He connected on all seven of his attempts in the first quarter on the way to 18 points -- his season high for a single period.The Miami Heat enjoyed a return home after a disappointing 1-3 road trip, beating the Indiana Pacers 116-111.Bam Adebayo scored 38 points and Jimmy Butler added 25 as the Heat stretched their season-best home win streak to seven games."

    "articleBody": "Russell Westbrook led Los Angeles with 29 points off the bench and superstar LeBron James added 23 for a Lakers team that has struggled to find consistency amid injuries -- including the foot trouble sidelining Anthony Davis.But it was German guard Schroder who starred late, serenely draining a pair of free throws to pull the Lakers within one -- at 120-119 -- with 13.2 seconds left.On Memphis' ensuing possession he poked the ball away from Desmond Bane and raced up the court with it for a layup. Fouled on the play, he made the free throw to put the Lakers up 122-120.The Grizzles would have another chance, but Ja Morant missed a driving shot and Brandon Clarke missed one of two free throws and the Lakers had the win.Morant shook off a slow start to lead Memphis with 22 points. Tyus Jones and John Konchar had 20 each off the bench, but the Grizzlies slipped a game and a half behind Western Conference leaders Denver, who beat Indiana 134-111 for their ninth straight victory.It was just the second time this season the Grizzles lost when leading after three quarters -- and just the second Lakers' win when trailing through three.But it wasn't the only unlikely outcome on the night as Jordan Poole and Golden State put on a shooting clinic in Cleveland, the Warriors draining 23 three-pointers in a 120-114 victory with Stephen Curry and three other starters on the bench.Curry, Klay Thompson, Andrew Wiggins and Draymond Green all sat out the contest a day after the NBA champions' heartbreaking overtime loss to the Celtics in Boston.But with 32 points from Poole and 22 from Ty Jerome the Warriors posted their first road victory this season over a team with a winning record.The Warriors set the tone early, connecting on seven of eight three-pointers in the first quarter. Their 14 first-half three-pointers matched the most ever by a Cleveland opponent for one half.Golden State pushed a five-point halftime lead to as many as 20 in the third. Cleveland sliced the deficit to four with two minutes remaining, but Jerome promptly drained another three-pointer and the Warriors were off again.Warriors coach Steve Kerr was unrepentant about sitting his starters, saying banged up players had to be given a chance to rest or risk injury.Darius Garland scored 21 to lead Cleveland, who were again without three-time All-Star Donovan Mitchell because of a groin injury.\n                  \nMurray leads Denver                \n                  \nIn Denver, two-time reigning MVP Nikola Jokic was sidelined with a hamstring injury.But teammate Jamal Murray scored 17 points with 14 assists and 10 rebounds for the first triple-double of his career to lead the Nuggets over the Pacers.In Dallas, the Mavericks' MVP candidate Luka Doncic scored 34 points -- making five of his eight three-point attempts -- with 12 rebounds and seven assists in a 115-90 rout of the Miami Heat.Brooklyn's Kyrie Irving put on a show in Salt Lake City, scoring a season-high 48 points to lead the Nets to a 117-106 victory over the Utah Jazz."

    "articleBody": "Miami talisman Butler finished with a perfect 23-of-23 free throws -- including a clutch game-winner with just under 13 seconds remaining -- in a nail-biting victory at the FTX Arena.Butler's haul was part of a remarkable 40-for-40 free throws made by Miami, breaking the old record of 39-for-39 made by Utah against Portland in 1982.Butler said afterwards he had been oblivious to Miami's record-breaking night from the foul line.\"I had no idea,\" Butler told reporters. \"I'm more excited that we won this game by one point.\"Miami coach Erik Spoelstra was also unaware of his team's free-throw record.\"I didn't realise we hadn't missed a free throw,\" Spoelstra said. \"We've been a very good free-throw shooting team all year, but that's crazy.\"Miami trailed 111-106 with less than a minute remaining but fought back with a Victor Oladipo three-pointer and a Butler layup to tie the game.Butler's 23rd free throw of the night edged Miami into a one-point lead with just under 13 seconds remaining before Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's attempted three-pointer to win it for Oklahoma City bounced off the rim.\"We had to make some plays and we did,\" Spoelstra said of his team's last-minute rally.Miami improved to 22-20 while the Thunder fell to 18-23.\n                  \nEmbiid returns                   \n                  \nElsewhere there were contrasting fortunes for Philadelphia's Joel Embiid and Golden State's Stephen Curry as they returned from injury.Sixers ace Embiid had missed three straight games with a minor foot injury heading into Tuesday's Eastern Conference clash against lowly Detroit.But the two-time MVP runner-up looked back to his dominant self with 36 points in just 23 minutes on court as Philadelphia romped to a 147-116 victory at the Wells Fargo Center.Embiid's points tally came from 12-of-20 shooting, while the Sixers big man also chipped in with 11 rebounds and two blocks.James Harden and Tyrese Maxey added 16 points each while Tobias Harris had 14 points as Philadelphia led from start to finish to improve to 25-15.Harden's points tally was part of a second straight triple double. The 10-time All-Star added 12 rebounds and 15 assists.After jumping out to a 65-43 half-time lead, the Sixers cut loose in a blizzard of scoring in the third quarter with 42 points before adding 40 more in the fourth.Philadelphia remain in fifth place in the East, 3.5 games adrift of leaders Boston. Detroit are rooted to the foot of the table with a dismal 11-33 record.But there was disappointment for Warriors star Curry in San Francisco as he returned from an 11-game absence to face a Phoenix Suns team decimated by injuries.Curry scored 24 points -- including five three-pointers -- but was unable to stop the Warriors falling 125-113 to Phoenix.Mikal Bridges top-scored for Phoenix with 26 points.In Los Angeles, Kawhi Leonard's 33 points helped the Clippers complete a 113-101 win over the Dallas Mavericks.Luka Doncic led the game scoring with 43 points for Dallas, but the Mavs were chasing the game from the outset as the Clippers completed a wire-to-wire win.In Salt Lake City, Jordan Clarkson's 32-point performance, including a crucial 9-0 run in the fourth quarter, helped the Utah Jazz upset the high-flying Cleveland Cavaliers 116-114.Lauri Markkanen added support with 25 points while Malik Beasley, Mike Conley and Nickeil Alexander-Walker all chipped in with 13 points each.Cleveland's Donovan Mitchell produced another high-scoring performance with 46 points but it was not enough to deny Utah victory."

    "articleBody": "A tumultuous day that began with Brooklyn's sacking of head coach Steve Nash ended with the Nets blowing a 12-point third-quarter lead as Chicago surged to victory at the Barclays Center.Interim coach Jacque Vaughn took over on the sidelines for the Nets, but could only watch in dismay as Brooklyn wilted in the fourth quarter once again.Chicago outscored the Nets 31-19 in the fourth quarter, with LaVine raining down 20 points in the final frame to finish with 29 points, including five assists and four rebounds.DeMar DeRozan provided offensive support with 20 points while Goran Dragic added 15 and Patrick Williams 12. Ayo Dosunmu added 17 points from the bench.The Nets meanwhile saw Kevin Durant tally 32 points with nine rebounds and six assists while Royce O'Neale chipped in with 20 points. Yuta Watanabe and Nic Claxton added 10 points apiece.Kyrie Irving had a frustrating night for Brooklyn, finishing with four points after shooting just 2-of-12 from the field.Durant admitted afterward that Nash's abrupt dismissal earlier Tuesday had been on his mind in the hours before the game, revealing that he had first learned of it on television.\"I woke up from my nap and turned to my right and saw it on ESPN,\" Durant said. \"I was shocked. You're always shocked when a move like this happens, but it's normal in the NBA.\"So you just get ready for the game. It's a quick turnaround in the league so you can't think too much about it -- but it was on my mind for a little bit today.\"\n                  \n- 'I liked Steve' -                  \n                  \nDurant -- who requested a trade from Brooklyn in the offseason before later issuing an ultimatum to replace Nash or let him go -- insisted he had a good relationship with the dismissed coach.\"I liked working with Steve, I liked the coaching staff,\" Durant said.\n \n\"It was a roller coaster last few years but the core of it - the basketball -- is something we all loved to do. I enjoyed coming to work with Steve.\"We didn't have a healthy team, and we didn't play well. That's what happens in the league. It doesn't take away from Steve's basketball IQ, or how he teaches the game. It just didn't work out.\"Brooklyn fell to 2-6 with the defeat and are languishing near the foot of the Eastern Conference while Chicago improved to 4-4, snapping a two-game losing streak.In other games on Tuesday, the Golden State Warriors slumped to a third straight loss with a 116-109 defeat to the Miami Heat in Florida.A back-and-forth game saw nine lead changes before Miami finally pulled clear in the closing stages of the fourth quarter to claim a win that leaves the NBA champion Warriors at 3-5 for the season.Max Strus led the Miami scoring with 24 points while Jimmy Butler added 23 with six rebounds and eight assists.Stephen Curry had a triple double for the Warriors, with 23 points, 13 rebounds and 13 assists but it was not enough to drag Golden State over the line.Warriors coach Steve Kerr took positives from his team's performance despite the loss.\"I thought we played well enough to win but we didn't close it out,\" Kerr said. \"I give Miami credit, they stifled us in the last five minutes. We knew they were going to be competitive, and we got their best punch in that fourth quarter.\n \n\"We just couldn't close the deal.\"Elsewhere on Tuesday, the Phoenix Suns notched their fifth straight victory with a 116-107 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves in Arizona, thanks to 29 points from Cameron Johnson."

    "datePublished": "October 26, 2022 12:39",
    "articleBody": "Booker produced another 30-point scoring exhibition for the third straight game as the Suns laid down an early marker against the defending NBA champions.The 25-year-old Phoenix talisman was also at the center of a third-quarter skirmish with Thompson that led to the Warriors' future Hall-of-Famer being tossed for the first time in his 651-game career. Thompson was expelled after he bumped Booker midway through the third quarter to earn a technical before earning a second technical as he unleashed a tirade at the Suns and referee Ed Malloy.That flashpoint proved decisive, with the Suns exploiting the Warriors' lack of composure to turn an 83-77 advantage into a 13-point lead at 90-77.The Suns would eventually outscore the Warriors 33-20 in the third to take a 105-86 lead into the final period.Golden State rallied to cut the deficit to 12 points midway through the fourth, but Phoenix pulled away once again to seal a deserved victory.Booker, who has averaged 32 points in four games to start the campaign, said Phoenix were determined to impress against the reigning NBA champions.\"Those are the defending champs over there,\" Booker said. \"They have a culture, an environment, they're holding the crown.\n\"Every time we match up against them we want to play hard and play competitive.\"Booker made no apologies for his spirited clash with Warriors veteran Thompson.\n\"I love Klay Thompson, and I have from the beginning, coming up. Right from the draft I said I wanted to be Klay Thompson,\" Booker said. \n\"But that doesn't excuse us from competing against each other and talking a little mess with each other... big fan of his and his competitive nature, and that's that.\"Warriors coach Steve Kerr also played down the Booker-Thompson clash.\"They're both great competitors, both great players,\" Kerr said. \"This is the NBA -- it's the highest competition in the world. Stuff like that happens.\"Booker was given scoring support from Mikal Bridges with 17 points while Deandre Ayton and Chris Paul added 16 points each.Stephen Curry led the Warriors scoring with 21 points with Jordan Poole adding 17. Thompson departed with two points after making just 1-of-8 from the field.\n                  \nDoncic falls short              \n                  \nElsewhere Tuesday, Luka Doncic scored 37 points but it was not enough to stop the Dallas Mavericks slipping to defeat against the depleted New Orleans Pelicans.Slovenian star Doncic dragged the Mavs to within one point of the Pels with four seconds remaining after a driving lay-up made it 112-111.The 23-year-old was left shaking his head in disappointment after a three-point effort on the buzzer that would have snatched victory bounced off the rim to hand New Orleans a 113-111 win.Doncic finished with 11 rebounds and seven assists in addition to his 37-point haul, with Spencer Dinwiddie providing support with 24 points and Christian Wood 23 points.But Dallas were ultimately pipped by a balanced New Orleans line-up that saw eight players finish in double figures.The victory was made all the more impressive given injuries that deprived New Orleans of regular starters Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram.Trey Murphy III scored 22 points -- making 8-of-8 from the field -- while C.J. McCollum made 14 points with 11 assists.McCollum later admitted he could barely watch as Doncic launched his last-gasp three-point attempt on the buzzer.\"When he shot it I just thought 'Please don't go in, please don't go in',\" McCollum told an on-court interviewer.\n\"I didn't shoot the ball well but a lot of young guys stepped up tonight and that's what we're going to need all season long.\"The Pelicans improved to 3-1 with a win to move into second in the Western Conference behind leaders Portland. Dallas fell to 1-2.The Washington Wizards took their season record to 3-1 with a 120-99 romp against the Detroit Pistons at home.Kyle Kuzma led the Washington scorers with 25 points with Kristaps Porzingis adding 20. Will Barton added 16 from the bench, including four three-pointers.Oklahoma City meanwhile routed the Los Angeles Clippers 108-94 with Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scoring 33 points."

    "articleBody": "The rebuilding San Antonio Spurs stunned the Sixers 114-105 in Philadelphia, where frustrated 76ers coach Doc Rivers said after the game his team was \"not ready\" to win yet.In Orlando, Tatum's exploits and a 27-point contribution from guard Derrick White helped the Celtics notch another win in a game that featured 21 lead changes with neither team able to build a double-digit advantage.Orlando big man Wendell Carter knotted the score at 111-111 with a put-back dunk with 4:23 to play.Carter then fouled Tatum and Tatum's two free throws ignited a 10-2 scoring run that put Boston up for good.Terrence Ross led the Magic with 29 points and top draft pick Paolo Banchero added 23, but Orlando fell to 0-3.That's also where the 76ers found themselves after the inexperienced Spurs -- whose championship chances were downplayed by none other than coach Gregg Popovich before the season -- drained 16 three-pointers on the way to their second straight win.Devin Vassell scored 22 points, Keldon Johnson added 21 and Tre Jones chipped in 17 for San Antonio while Doug McDermott made four three-pointers on the way to 14 points.San Antonio's top-scoring trio all have less than three years experience in the league, and Popovich said he was impressed with the young team's performance on the second night of a road back-to-back.\"What it showed me was they are serious about getting better and knowing what the league is like,\" Popovich said.The Spurs withstood a 40-point performance from Philadelphia's star big man Joel Embiid but held James Harden to 12.\"We're not ready yet,\" Rivers said. \"Honestly, we're just not. We're not ready to win yet. You can feel that and so we've got a lot of work to do.\"It's almost like we played these first two games hard, competed, and then felt like 'OK, now we can win some games' -- you've still got to go out and earn the game.\""

He's played a lot this summer with the Greek national team and played internationally all over the world and he carries a big load.\"So it's our job to sometimes be the bad guys and we have to try and keep him healthy and in a good place for a long, long season.\"Young was pleased to have improved his performance on Saturday compared to Game 1 and says Abu Dhabi served the team well in building chemistry with the new additions to the Hawks roster.\"I don't think I shot the ball really well last game. I knew I could have shot the ball better, I did that tonight and that's what pre-season is for, to get back into it. We've got a new team so I'm here just learning my new team-mates and just trying to see where we're at,\" said Young.The NBA Games in Abu Dhabi were the organisation's first ever to be staged in the Gulf region and Arab world. Two sold-out nights saw a combined 23,000 people attend the games at Etihad Arena."

    "articleBody": "Mumbai Indians are favourites to claim a historic third successive Indian Premier League crown back on home soil.The Indians retained their title in Dubai last year with a victory over Delhi Capitals, taking their record tally of IPL triumphs to a five.Rohit Sharma's side will be the team to beat in a competition that will be played in Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Mumbai and Kolkata, having been staged overseas in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic.The Capitals and Royal Challengers Bangalore look the most likely sides to prevent Mumbai from becoming the first franchise to win three consecutive IPL titles.We pick out some of the things to look out for in what promises to be a mouthwatering extravaganza of cricket, which starts on Friday in a country that will stage the T20 World Cup later this year. INDIANS PRIMED FOR THREE IN A ROWThe champions start the defence of their title with a blockbuster showdown against RCB in the first game of the tournament at M. A. Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai.Mumbai will have to wait for Quinton de Kock's arrival as he is on duty with South Africa, so skipper Rohit will be expected to set the tone at the top of the order.The India opener is the fourth-highest run-scorer in IPL history with 5,230 at an average of 31.31 and, although the 2020 edition was not one of his best, he struck a rapid 68 in the final. Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav played significant hands with the bat in Mumbai's 2020 success.Trent Boult was man of the match in that win over Delhi after taking 3-30 and the New Zealand seamer will have a big part to play with the ball along with Jasprit Bumrah. STAND-IN SKIPPER PANT CAN LEAD BY EXAMPLEDelhi's first IPL final proved to be painful in November, but they will fancy their chances of going one better under the captaincy of Rishabh Pant.The addition of Steve Smith, who was released by Rajasthan Royals, is a major tonic, while Umesh Yadav and Sam Billings are among their other new recruits.Kagiso Rabada was the leading wicket-taker in last year's tournament with 30 at 18.26 and Delhi will need him to fire again along with fellow Proteas quick Anrich Nortje.Ravichandran Ashwin should be on a high from his Test exploits for India against England, while the in-form Pant can thrive as skipper with Shreyas Iyer ruled out due to a shoulder injury.MORRIS UNDER PRESSURE TO JUSTIFY PRICE TAGChris Morris became the most expensive signing in IPL history when he was snapped up by Rajasthan Royals for 16.25crore (around £1.6million).That staggering fee put the South Africa all-rounder ahead of Yuvraj Singh (16cr) as the biggest ever auction acquisition.Morris was 20th on the list of the leading wicket-takers last year when featuring for RCB and only batted five times, with a top score of 25 not out. ROY TO REUNITE WITH BAIRSTOWEngland batsman Roy went unsold at auction but was drafted in by Sunrisers Hyderabad last week after Mitchell Marsh withdrew for personal reasons.Sunrisers coach Trevor Bayliss was clearly excited by the prospect of Roy and Jonny Bairstow forming a pairing that has served England so well.Roy may have to wait for his opportunity or Sunrisers could tinker with the order, as captain David Warner and Bairstow have formed a dangerous opening pairing."

    "datePublished": "January 28, 2021 14:10",
    "articleBody": "Pakistan took three priceless wickets in a devastating 25-minute burst before the close to leave South Africa in deep trouble in the first Test.A gripping third day of the clash in Karachi looked set to be one that ended with South Africa in healthy shape in their second innings, but the impressive Yasir Shah had other thoughts and helped reduce the tourists to 187-4, for a slender lead of 29 runs.The losses of Rassie van der Dussen (64), Faf du Plessis (10) and Aiden Markram (74) in that rush of wickets meant the advantage was firmly with Pakistan at the close.In the first of two Tests, Pakistan had earlier frustrated their visitors with the bat when a wagging tail saw them move from 308-8 at the start of Thursday's play to 378 all out.That gave Pakistan a first-innings lead of 158, not bad going for a team who had been 27-4 at one stage.Kagiso Rabada removed Hasan Ali in the morning, smashing his middle stump out of the ground, and the South Africa paceman's figures of 3-70 took him to 200 Test wickets.But Pakistan's lower order largely showed impressive defiance, and number 11 batsman Yasir, who has a Test century to his name, was stranded on 38 not out when Nauman Ali (24) was last man out.Yasir would soon get his leg breaks turning and removed Dean Elgar for 29 to break up South Africa's opening partnership.Markram, who has enjoyed hot spells with the bat on home soil, then looked to have chosen an opportune moment to make a first Test half-century outside South Africa, but the events of the final half-hour saw Pakistan wrest back control.Abid Ali took a sharp catch at silly mid-off to give Yasir the important wicket of Van der Dussen, ending a 127-run second-wicket partnership.Du Plessis had an early life when a review spared him an lbw dismissal, the ball from Yasir shown to have pitched millimetres outside leg stump.But Yasir would not be denied for long and soon had his man pinned in front again, with no doubts second time around.Markram was prised out by Nauman moments later, prodding to silly mid-off, as the complexion of the contest changed completely.\nYasir a game-changerFirst came his quickfire runs from number 11, the sort of innings that causes opponents deep frustration, but then we saw Yasir at his best with the ball. Markram and Van der Dussen looked to be leading South Africa to a healthy position - and to be only one down and back in the black at the start of Friday's play would have been a huge boon. But Yasir (3-53) kept his focus sharp and his deliveries repeatedly hitting the mark in those closing overs, and the rewards deservedly came his way.Breakthrough for MarkramThe South Africa opener has four Test centuries but until this innings he had curiously never posted a fifty outside his home country in the five-day game. It was a purposeful, positive knock and looked set to see him grab the day's headlines, until Yasir put the Proteas in a spin. With wickets falling at the other end, Nauman seized the moment to prise out a presumably distracted Markram and land perhaps the most telling blow of all.Hope for tourists?If Pakistan were able to battle back from 27-4, then why shouldn't South Africa, who are 29 runs ahead in the match but also four down, also find runs in their middle and lower orders? Temba Bavuma and Keshav Maharaj have recent Test half-centuries, and the influence of captain Quinton de Kock, who resumes on nought on Friday, could be all-important."

    "articleBody": "South Africa halted a run of four consecutive defeats to Sri Lanka by securing a crushing innings victory in the first Test at Centurion.From 65-2 overnight going into day four, Sri Lanka could only make 180 all out as they succumbed to defeat by an innings and 45 runs.Unbeaten on 33 at the start of play, Kusal Perera went on to reach a patient 64, while Wanindu Hasaranga bludgeoned 54 in boundaries in a rapid-fire 59 that came from 53 deliveries.But Sri Lanka's task on Tuesday looked challenging from the off, particularly given they were without injured all-rounder Dhananjaya de Silva, who retired hurt in the first innings.After a pair of home wins in 2018, and two more in South Africa in early 2019, the Sri Lankans were eyeing a fifth successive Test victory over their hosts.Yet the location for this first leg of the two-match series boded well for South Africa, given they had won all four of their previous four Tests against Sri Lanka in Centurion.When Dinesh Chandimal fell for 25, bowled by Wiaan Mulder having added just four to his overnight score, the prospects of Sri Lanka avoiding defeat looked bleak.Facing a 225-run first-innings deficit, the tourists' hopes of making South Africa bat again grew more forlorn when Niroshan Dickwella (10) was caught behind off Mulder.The end of Perera effectively spelled the end of Sri Lankan hopes, with a review showing he snicked a fine delivery from Anrich Nortje through to wicketkeeper and captain Quinton de Kock.Hasaranga's entertaining cameo containing 12 fours and a six came to an end when one blow too many saw him caught by Temba Bavuma in the deep off Lutho Sipamla, and Kasun Rajitha was dismissed by Nortje for a 27-ball duck to wrap up the game.The second Test begins in Johannesburg on January 3."

    "articleBody": "Brilliant hostile bowling led by Trent Boult, who took 3-30, restricted Delhi to 156-7. Mumbai powered to 157-5 with eight balls to spare and captain Rohit Sharma hitting 68.Sharma, 33, led the chase in his 200th IPL appearance to inspire the most successful team in the Twenty20 tournament to add to triumphs in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019.Boult took opener Marcus Stoinis with the first ball of the final in Dubai, giving the upstart Delhi side a grim warning of the tough night ahead in the empty stadium.Ajinkya Rahane was caught behind for two in Boult's next over. Jasprit Bumrah's fiery pace also kept Delhi in check.Mumbai brought in off-spinner Jayant Yadav to bowl the fourth over and he immediately bowled in-form opener Shikhar Dhawan for 15.Delhi skipper Shreyas Iyer, who made an unbeaten 65, and Rishabh Pant rebuilt the innings with a partnership of 96. But Australian paceman Nathan Coulter-Nile took Pant's wicket for 56 -- his first fifty of a disappointing season.Boult got Shimron Hetmyer for five with a slower short ball and he returned figures of 3-30 from four overs of devastating left-arm pace.Iyer went past 500 runs in a season for the first time but Delhi managed just 38 runs in the last five overs, with the loss of three wickets, and Mumbai quickly took control of the run chase.Sharma and Quinton de Kock set a blistering pace with 45 runs in the first 25 balls before De Kock was caught behind off Stoinis for 20. Later Suryakumar Yadav was run out for 19 in a mix-up with Sharma.Sharma hit four sixes and five fours in his 51-ball innings and nearly finished the game off with Ishan Kishan but fell to South African quick Anrich Nortje just before the end.Kishan stood firm with his unbeaten 33 as Mumbai got the better of Delhi for the fourth time this year, including a drubbing in the first semi-final qualifier.Delhi fast bowler Kagiso Rabada took the wicket of Kieron Pollard, for nine, to lead this season's bowling rankings with 30 scalps over Mumbai's Bumrah on 27."

    "articleBody": "Delhi Capitals reached the final of the Indian Premier League for the first time as a tremendous batting display powered them to a 17-run win over Sunrisers Hyderabad.Shikhar Dhawan (78) and Marcus Stoinis (38) combined for an opening partnership of 86 in Sunday's second qualifier.An unbeaten 42 from Shimron Hetmyer helped Delhi to 189-3, a total that proved beyond Sunrisers despite the best efforts of Kane Williamson (67) and Abdul Samad (33).They were each well set at the crease at the start of the 17th over with Sunrisers needing a manageable 51 off 24 deliveries.However, Stoinis and Kagiso Rabada ensured there was to be no dramatic finish as the Capitals made history.Delhi will face Mumbai Indians in Tuesday's final.ALL OR NOTHING DHAWAN DELIVERSDhawan came into this game with three ducks in his last four innings, the sole exception being a half-century against Royal Challengers Bangalore.He rekindled the form he demonstrated against RCB, hitting six fours and a pair of sixes but his exit to a Sandeep Sharma full toss in the penultimate over played a role in Delhi failing to get to 200.STOINIS & RABADA SEAL ITStoinis played a key role in setting the platform for Delhi alongside Dhawan and proved the key man with the ball with figures of 3-26.His third wicket was the critical one, as Williamson sliced a wide delivery to Rabada at deep cover.Rabada (4-29) then produced a stunning penultimate over, removing Samad, Rashid Khan and Shreevats Goswami in the space of three legal deliveries - the latter two sandwiched by a wide - to effectively end the Sunrisers' hopes."

    "articleBody": "Jason Holder smacked an unbeaten 26 as Sunrisers Hyderabad boosted their hopes of an Indian Premier League play-off spot with a five-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bangalore. Bangalore posted 120-7 after being asked to make first use of a slow wicket at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium, captain Virat Kohli (7) failing to make an impression with the bat. The Sunrisers suffered a wobble as they closed in on the total, but a brutal cameo from Holder, off just 10 balls and including three sixes, secured the win with 35 deliveries to spare. The victory means the Sunrisers climb up to fourth place on 12 points with just one round of fixtures in the round-robin stage remaining. However, they are only ahead of Kings Punjab XI, Rajasthan Royals and Kolkata Knight Riders on run-rate with the race to make the play-offs set to go down to the wire.Josh Philippe had held together RCB's innings with a composed knock, making 32 off 31 balls after Sandeep Sharma (2-20) had removed Devdutt Padikkal (5) and Kohli in quick succession. The Bangalore innings continued to splutter, though, and when Philippe was caught off leg-spinner Rashid Khan (1-24), any momentum was lost. Experienced duo Wriddhiman Saha (39) and Manish Pandey (26) had the Sunrisers coasting, both eventually falling to Yuzvendra Chahal (2-19). When Kane Williamson softly drove left-arm seamer Isuru Udana into the hands of Kohli with the score on 87-4, the Royal Challengers had a ray of hope. Yet Holder took any pressure off his team by clobbering sixes off Udana and Navdeep Saini, then hit the winning runs with another maximum off Chahal.HOLDER HOLDS HIS NERVE Disciplined spells at the start and end of Bangalore's innings from the West Indies Test captain led to good bowling figures of 2-27, but it was the manner in which Holder finished off the game with the bat that was more impressive. \"I was positive with the bat and just set out to win the game, so it was pleasing,\" Holder said in the post-match presentation ceremony. \"Being a replacement here it is a while since I have played IPL cricket, so I'm just trying to make the most of it.\" KOHLI SINKS TO SANDEEP AGAIN With 424 runs at an average of 53.00 in this year's IPL heading into the match, there was an expectancy Kohli would again be the key for Bangalore. Instead, he was dismissed cheaply by a familiar face, Sandeep Sharma getting the India captain for the seventh time in the Twenty20 format."

    "articleBody": "Rajasthan Royals came through a six-hitting onslaught from Chris Gayle to beat Kings XI Punjab, keeping them firmly in contention for the Indian Premier League play-offs. Gayle surpassed 1,000 career maximums in Twenty20 cricket - the first player to reach that number - before being dismissed for 99, bowled by Jofra Archer (2-26).The left-hander's wonderful 63-ball knock, coupled with a late cameo from fellow West Indian Nicholas Pooran (22), powered Kings XI to 185-4. However, the Royals overhauled that total with seven wickets in hand, moving them level with their fourth-placed opponents on 12 points as the round-robin stage draws towards a close. Ben Stokes led the way in the chase with a 26-ball 50 at the top of the order, while Sanju Samson made 48 and Rajasthan skipper Steve Smith finished up unbeaten on 31. Jos Buttler hurried his team to their target with two late sixes as he made 22 not out from 11 deliveries, the Royals clinching victory thanks to a Chris Jordan wide midway through the 18th over.  GAYLE LAUNCHES INTO ROYALSThere was to be no 23rd T20 century for Gayle, though the 41-year-old still reached a notable milestone during his innings. He boosted his career sixes total with eight more on Friday, including one off Archer in the 20th over that took him to 1,001.However, the bowler got his revenge with the next ball, aided by a deflection off bat and pad. Gayle threw his bat after falling just short, then shared a handshake with Archer before departing.ROYALS RUNNING INTO FORMHaving returned figures of 2-32 with the ball, Stokes gave Rajasthan's reply the early impetus it required. His half-century here followed on from an unbeaten 107 against Mumbai Indians last time out.The England international appears to be coming into form at the perfect time for the Royals, though they still remain outside the top four in the table. They have one game remaining - against fellow play-off hopefuls Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday - and the fight to qualify could well come down to net run-rate."

His knock, which included seven sixes and two fours, was the fourth-fastest of this season's IPL. Mumbai opener Ishan Kishan went for 37 in spectacular circumstances, with Stokes' England team-mate Jofra Archer taking an acrobatic one-handed catch by the boundary.The Indians might have thought they had done enough to secure an eighth win in 11 games this season but Stokes and Sanju Samson had other ideas, the pair putting on a third-wicket stand of 152 from 82 balls to take the Royals home with 10 balls to spare Rajasthan move up to sixth in the table with 10 points from their 12 games, while the result condemns Chennai Super Kings, who had thumped Royal Challengers Bangalore earlier in the day, to elimination. STOKES FINALLY ARRIVES IN THIS SEASON'S IPL  Stokes had struggled to make an impact in the IPL before his match-winning turn on Sunday, scoring just 110 runs off 103 balls in this season's competition. The 29-year-old said he felt in confident mood ahead of Sunday's game thanks to a positive training session a day earlier. \"I'm a bit taken aback by why it's taken me so long to get into the tournament for the team,\" he said. \"To be honest, the training I've had yesterday was the best I had throughout my time here, so I came into this with a bit of confidence.

The England all-rounder has performed whatever role required efficiently and is now his franchise's leading wicket-taker in 2020. His left-arm seam accounted for a trio of big names, as he dismissed Aaron Finch early on before returning to take out international team-mate Moeen Ali and the key wicket of Kohli in the 19th over. CHENNAI OPEN TO CHANGE Gaikwad recorded his maiden half-century in the Twenty20 tournament, producing a fluent 51-ball innings that included three sixes. The right-hander, 23, completed the job in style, pulling a Chris Morris short ball over the boundary. It was a far cry from his previous knock too, having fallen for a duck against Mumbai Indians last time out."

    "articleBody": "Jason Holder made an instant impact and Manish Pandey cut loose as Sunrisers Hyderabad stopped the rot with an eight-wicket Indian Premier League win over Rajasthan Royals.David Warner's Sunrisers had lost three consecutive games but ended their slump with an impressive performance in Dubai on Thursday.West Indies captain Holder, unsold at the IPL auction but drafted in to replace the injured Mitchell Marsh last month, took 3-33 and also ran out Robin Uthappa in his first appearance of the tournament.Sanju Samson top-scored with 36 and Ben Stokes laboured to 30 as the Royals could only post 154-6 after Warner put them in.Jofra Archer blasted a quickfire 16 and then removed Warner yet again before bowling his England team-mate Jonny Bairstow in a rapid early burst.At 16-2 in the third over of Sunrisers' reply it was very much game on, but an unbroken stand of 140 between Pandey (83 not out) and Vijak Shankar (52) consigned Rajasthan to defeat.Pandey was the chief aggressor, hitting eight sixes in a brilliant 47-ball knock to move Sunrisers up to fifth, finding great support from Shankar, who hit the winning runs off the first ball of the 19th over.HOLDER GRASPS HIS CHANCEAll-rounder Holder was given his opportunity after Kane Williamson was ruled out and he grabbed it with both hands.He ended an opening stand of 30 by producing a sharp piece of work to dismiss Uthappa with a direct hit and then bowled the dangerous Samson with a slower ball, having seen the previous delivery disappear for six.Holder was not finished there, removing Steve Smith and Riyan Parag from successive deliveries. He bowled 11 dot balls in an impressive start with ball in hand. PANDEY PUMMELS ROYALS Archer rocked Sunrisers with a hostile opening spell, Stokes taking a good slip catch to ensure his England colleague has dismissed the Australia opener six times in seven innings.Bairstow also failed to hang around, but Pandey and Shankar took charge of the run chase with a stand that sapped the life out of the Royals.Shankar was content to score at just over a run a ball as Pandey produced a masterful display of timing, power and use of the feet, reaching his half-century in 28 balls and finishing with a 176.59 strike rate.Kartik Tyagi and Stokes were hit for three sixes apiece as Pandey put the Royals attack to the sword. Only Samson and Ishan Kishan - with nine apiece - have scored more maximums in an IPL innings this year."

He has also racked up 285 in his last four knocks versus KKR at an average of 142.5."

    "articleBody": "Shikhar Dhawan's second consecutive IPL century was not enough for Delhi Capitals to overcome a resurgent Kings XI Punjab, who claimed a five-wicket victory in Dubai - their third win in a row.Dhawan became the first player in the history of the tournament to register back-to-back tons, carrying his bat for an accomplished 106 not out that accounted for the bulk of 164 for five.The lack of support for the India opener cost Delhi dear, however, with 14 their next highest individual score, and contributions throughout won the day for the Kings XI.In at number three after a breezy 15 from captain KL Rahul, Chris Gayle tucked into the beleaguered Tushar Deshpande, hitting three fours and two sixes in a riotous fifth over.After Gayle was bowled by Ravichandran Ashwin for 29 and Mayank Agarwal was run out in the sixth over, another West Indian in Nicholas Pooran thrillingly picked up the baton.Pooran compiled a blistering half-century as he added 69 for the fourth wicket alongside Glenn Maxwell. He departed the ball after reaching his milestone, edging the impressive Kagiso Rabada (2-27) behind for a 28-ball 53.Maxwell departed for 32 when Rishabh Pant pouched a swirling chance off Rabada but Deepak Hooda and Jimmy Neesham - 15 and 10 not out respectively - finished the job authoritatively, the New Zealander planting Daniel Sams over midwicket to finish matters with an over to spare.Dhawan plays stunning lone handDhawan is in simply irresistible form. His knock on Tuesday made it two centuries and two fifties in his past four innings. During that time he has scored 333 runs and been dismissed only once. However, it would be nice for some of his team-mates to join him. Pant matched skipper Shreyas Iyer's 14 but did so glacially off 20 deliveries.Deshpande dominatedThe right-arm medium pacer found himself in the eye of the storm against Gayle and things got no better when a rampant Pooran tucked into him. A ploy of slow, short deliveries missed the mark horribly and Deshpande's two overs cost 41, featuring five fours and three sixes."

That left Nicholas Pooran to come out and face one ball, which he proceeded to launch down the ground for six. The eight-wicket victory gives Kings XI renewed hope for the season, though they remain bottom of the table. Rahul – who made 132 not out in the previous meeting of the two franchises – finished up unbeaten on 61, in the process extending his lead at the top of the run-scoring table. Opening partner Mayank Agarwal weighed in with 45 as Bangalore's total of 171-6 was not quite enough, despite the unexpected final-over drama. Virat Kohli had top-scored with 48 but the Royal Challengers struggled to pick up the run-rate, making the decision to leave AB de Villiers down at six in the order even more surprising. The South African made just two but compatriot Chris Morris was far more successful in the closing stages, an eight-ball cameo seeing him make 25 not out. DE VILLIERS MADE TO WAIT De Villiers was at his explosive best against Kolkata Knight Riders last time out, smashing an unbeaten 73 from 33 balls. Despite that explosive display of hitting, Bangalore sent both Washington Sundar and Shivam Dube in ahead of him, before he eventually came out with four overs to go.THE UNIVERSE BOSS IS BACK!Gayle's involvement in the tournament was delayed by food poisoning, leading to a spell in hospital. He batted in the unfamiliar position of three for Kings XI, coming in after the opening duo had put on 78. After a cautious start, the left-hander cut loose with a solitary four and five sixes. Even his demise added a little drama, but Pooran finished the job in style with a maximum off Yuzvendra Chahal."

His pinch-hitting role bore fruit, with the English all-rounder cracking 31 before he was bowled by Sandeep Sharma from the 21st ball he faced.Shane Watson weighed in with 42 and Ambati Rayudu added 41, with their third-wicket partnership worth 81, and runs continued to flow.Hyderabad captain David Warner made a nervy start with the bat in the reply and it was no surprise that he fell cheaply, caught and bowled by Curran.At 93-3 after the 14th over, Sunrisers were off the pace, with Jonny Bairstow (23) having also gone early. Williamson kept them in it, striking seven fours before he holed out to Thakur at long-on off Karn Sharma's bowling.Sunrisers took 15 runs in a four-ball purple match, Rashid Khan and Shahbaz Nadeem cutting loose. But crucially Thakur gave away just four runs off the bat, plus a wide, in the 19th over.Rashid perished to the final ball of that over, given out hit-wicket after stepping back onto his off stump when taking a mighty swipe, before Bravo conceded just a single from an outstanding final set of six.Bravo for BravoHe gave credit to Thakur after the match, citing the 19th over of the Hyderabad innings as the key to victory, but Bravo (2-25) was nevertheless terrific when thrown the ball for the finale. Having Nadeem caught and bowled off a desperate slog killed the game, nailing a big win for CSK.Dhoni goes the distanceChennai skipper MS Dhoni added 21 handy runs at the end of his team's innings, and one shot will live long in the memory. T Natarajan sent down a delivery that was close to being a yorker but left Dhoni with just enough room to shuffle his feet and club the ball over long-on and into the top tier of the stand, a shot that was said to have travelled 102 metres. He was out next ball, mind."

    "articleBody": "Rajasthan Royals returned to winning ways in the Indian Premier League, producing a stunning late onslaught to down the Sunrisers Hyderabad by five wickets in Dubai. The Royals appeared in danger of suffering a fifth straight loss when, replying to Hyderabad's total of 158-4, they were left needing 54 from the final four overs in their run chase. However, Rahul Tewatia and Riyan Parag combined to see their team home with a delivery to spare, the latter sealing victory with a towering six over cover. Tewatia, though, had crucially gone after Hyderabad's key bowler in Rashid Khan, the leg-spinner's final over - the 18th of the innings - leaking 14, as he smashed 45 off 28 deliveries.  Parag finished up unbeaten on 42 from 26 as an unbroken stand worth 85 covered for the failures of the big names at the top of the order, including the returning Ben Stokes. The England all-rounder had earlier sent down just a solitary over as the Sunrisers set a competitive target thanks to contributions from captain David Warner (48) and Manish Pandey, who made 54. \n STOKES BACK, BUT ARCHER HITS THE SPOT It was a low-key comeback to cricket for Stokes. Having not played since August for family reasons, he made six from five balls as an opener for the Royals when batting alongside Jos Buttler (16).Instead, it was Jofra Archer who was the top-performing England player in action. He bowled a seriously quick over up front to international team-mate Jonny Bairstow, then returned later in the innings to emphatically clean up Warner as the Sunrisers skipper looked to cut loose. TEWATIA TURNS THE TABLES It seemed the Sunrisers were set to prevail having knocked over the Royals' top order cheaply, including running out Steve Smith for five. Yet Tewatia had other ideas, particularly when it came the pivotal over from Rashid. Having gone for just 12 from his previous three, the Afghanistan bowler was the subject of two outrageous reverse sweeps, both of which went to the boundary."

    "articleBody": "Virat Kohli produced another super Saturday match-winning effort as Royal Challengers Bangalore crushed Chennai Super Kings in Dubai.Seven days after Kohli's unbeaten 72 saw Bangalore pull off an eight-wicket victory over Rajasthan Royals, the captain was at it again as his 90 not out paved the way for a 37-run win.His 52-ball heroics came in a team effort of 169-4, and Chennai could only splutter 132-8 in response, with Chris Morris taking 3-19 and snagging a run out.It gave the Royal Challengers a fourth win in six games in the Indian Premier League this season, a record only beaten at this stage by Delhi Capitals.Between last Saturday's success and their latest win, Bangalore slumped to a disappointing defeat to Delhi, albeit with Kohli making a team-best 43, and the India captain was at his magnificent best again on this occasion.From 103-4 at the end of the 16th over, Royal Challengers Bangalore drastically stepped up the run rate, with 66 runs coming from those closing four overs as Kohli pushed the accelerator.He and Shivam Dube took the fight to Chennai, riding their luck at times but also producing an array of the spectacular.Sam Curran struck unlucky from the first ball of the 18th over when he almost had Dube caught at long-off, only for Narayan Jagadeesan to drop the ball over the boundary.That was the first of three sixes from the English paceman's over, which cost 24 runs and gave Bangalore all the impetus they needed.Chennai's reply was steady until it called for a big push in the final six overs, which they began with eight wickets in hand and 81 runs required.Morris made a vital breakthrough when he threw down the stumps as Jagadeesan looked for a quick single, and the South African then removed Curran, Ravindra Jadeja and Dwayne Bravo, snuffing out Chennai hopes.Jagadeesan the joggerIt would have been perhaps the slowest of quick singles if Jagadeesan had got home for Chennai, but of course Morris had other ideas as the third wicket fell.The 24-year-old had made a handy 33 at a healthy enough clip when he prodded away a delivery from Navdeep Saini and looked to add an extra single, but it looked unlikely from the off, and Morris was lethal with his execution of the throw at the stumps. Jagadeesan was nowhere near making his ground, replays showing him merely jogging towards the non-striker's end.Kohli gets better of DhoniWhile his captaincy counterpart MS Dhoni was caught at long-off for just 10 in the midst of Chennai's collapse, Kohli was terrific, and the decision to replace Moeen Ali with Morris also proved a masterstroke.Kohli has found his stride after a slow start to this IPL campaign, and Bangalore will hope the man with the most runs in the history of this competition can carry on leading them with such great fervour."

    "articleBody": "Mumbai Indians won a third straight match and moved top of the Indian Premier League as they recorded a 57-run win over slumping Rajasthan Royals on Tuesday.Suryakumar Yadav scored 79 not out from 47 balls as the Indians, who won the toss and elected to bat, set a strong total of 193-4 in Abu Dhabi.Jos Buttler smashed 70 from 44 deliveries in response but he lacked meaningful support from any of his Royals team-mates, who will be eagerly anticipating the availability of Ben Stokes once his period of quarantine in the United Arab Emirates is over.Jasprit Bumrah starred for the Indians with bowling figures of 4-20 – his best in the IPL – to ensure his team moved above the Delhi Capitals at the summit and condemned the Royals, who had won their first two matches, to a third consecutive defeat as they were bowled out for 136.\n YADAV GOES BIGAfter opener Quinton de Kock fell to IPL debutant Kartik Tyagi, Mumbai looked like they could be in trouble in their middle overs when Shreyas Gopal (2-28) removed Rohit Sharma (35) and Ishan Kishan (0) with successive deliveries.Krunal Pandya went to Jofra Archer for 12 but Yadav pushed the Indians forward, bringing up his fifty with a four off Tom Curran.Yadav established an unbeaten partnership worth 76 runs with Hardik Pandya (30 off 19) and finished with 11 fours and a pair of maximums for his highest IPL score.POLLARD DENIES BRILLIANT BUTTLERThe Royals' hopes of being competitive were effectively dashed inside their opening three overs as they lost Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sanju Samson to Trent Boult for ducks either side of Steve Smith swiping Bumrah to De Kock.Rajasthan were in poor shape at 12-3 – the third game in a row they have been three down inside seven overs – but Buttler launched five maximums and found the rope four more times to give them hope.However, a stunning catch from Kieron Pollard, who adjusted well in the deep after Buttler's shot initially hit his forearm, ended the wicketkeeper-batsman's electric knock.Bumrah capped a commanding display from the Indians by dismissing Rahul Tewatia (5) and Gopal (1) in the same over before accounting for Archer at the end of his next set of six."

    "articleBody": "Delhi Capitals moved clear at the top of the Indian Premier League table courtesy of a resounding 59-run win over Royal Challengers Bangalore. A strong batting performance that benefited from a late onslaught by the big-hitting Marcus Stoinis powered Delhi to 196-4 after they had been put into bat by Virat Kohli.Prithvi Shaw (42) was the aggressor in an opening stand worth 68 with Shikhar Dhawan, who contributed a more sedate 32 to the cause before departing in the 10th over. Rishabh Pant made 37 but it was Stoinis who stole the show in the closing overs, the Australian all-rounder blasting six fours and a pair of sixes as he made an unbeaten 53.Bangalore's reply simply never recovered after a poor start that saw them slip to 43-3, AB de Villiers among those to fall early. Captain Kohli top-scored with 43 before becoming one of four wickets for the excellent Kagiso Rabada, who now has 12 in this year's tournament at an average of 12.50. There were two wickets apiece for Anrich Nortje and Axar Patel too, the Royal Challengers eventually finishing well shy on 137-9 from their 20 overs. STOINIS STUNS ROYAL CHALLENGERS Stoinis had endured a lean spell since starting the new IPL season with 53 against Kings XI Punjab in Delhi's opener.  He had managed just 16 runs in three knocks since but was back to his destructive best against Bangalore, reaching his half-century off 24 deliveries as he added 89 for the third wicket with Pant.FINCH SPARED DESPITE R-ASH MOVEIn 2019, Ravichandran Ashwin caused a stir when, as captain of Kings XI, he ran out Rajathan Royals' Jos Buttler at the non-striker's end, the batsman having left his crease before the ball had been delivered.There was nearly a repeat when Ashwin had a similar situation with Aaron Finch here, but the India spinner opted instead to produce a stare at the out-of-position Bangalore batsman, followed quickly by a wry smile."

    "articleBody": "Defending champions Mumbai Indians were clinical with both bat and ball as Sunrisers Hyderabad fell well short in a 34-run defeat in Sunday's Indian Premier League match. Quinton de Kock smashed 67 off 39 balls and a 78-run stand with Ishan Kishan (31) was fundamental in building the foundations for Mumbai's score of 208-5. Krunal Pandya's explosion in the final over, during which he battered Siddarth Kaul for 20 from four balls, helped Mumbai get to that tally, which seemed to be above par on a slow pitch. David Warner made a pedestrian start, though he picked up the pace to at least gave Sunrisers a fighting chance until his knock was ended on 60, departing in the 16th over to effectively end their hopes. There was little help in a disappointing middle-order showing, with pace trio James Pattinson (2-29), Trent Boult (2-28) and Jasprit Bumrah (2-41) doing the damage for Mumbai, who restricted Sunrisers to 174-7. Victory means Mumbai now have three wins and two defeats from five games to move top of the table, while a third loss for Sunrisers leaves them sixth. QUINTON DE KOCK OF THE WALK Rohit Sharma (6) lasted just five deliveries but De Kock and Suryakumar Yadav (27) put on 42 before the big stand with Kishan boosted Mumbai. De Kock, who hit four fours and as many sixes, was the protagonist of the partnership, contributing 54 of the 78 runs. LACK OF SUPPORT FOR WARNER Pandya may have rued putting down Manish Pandey with a sitter at deep point when he went on to put on a 60-run partnership with Warner. But when Pandey clumsily chipped Pattinson to long off, Warner – who had five fours and two sixes in his 44-ball knock – was not helped by Kane Williamson (3) or Priyam Garg (8). When Warner got a thick edge to a slower one from Pattinson that was taken with a superb diving catch by Kishan at short third man, the game was up."

Another safety car on lap 54 enabled Verstappen to pit again and switch to soft tyres.When the safety car came off, just one dramatic lap remained and the two began it neck and neck.But the fresh tyres paid off for the 24-year-old Verstappen who surged through to win the race and the title to roars from the stands at the Yas Marina stands."

    "articleBody": "Valtteri Bottas will focus on making the most of starting the Turkish Grand Prix from pole position, and not on the fortunes of Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton.Bottas just missed out on setting the fastest time in Istanbul on Saturday, with championship leader Hamilton claiming top spot.However, Hamilton will start in 11th due to a penalty incurred from an engine change heading into the weekend, meaning Bottas is promoted to first on the grid.Seven out of the eight winners in Turkey have come from the first grid line, with the only exception coming last year when Hamilton triumphed from sixth place.Hamilton's title rival Max Verstappen will start in second place and has a real chance to regain the championship lead, as he trails by only two points as it stands – the finest margin after 15 races of a season since 2006.Asked where his priorities would sit heading into Sunday's race, Bottas said: \"I'll focus on my own race tomorrow, I think that's the way to go when you're starting in front and try to keep up a good pace.\"Of the session, the Finn, who is leaving Mercedes at the end of 2021, said: \"It was good. Not easy conditions, especially Q1 was a bit on the edge with damp parts and still Q3, the first corner was a bit damp but also Turn 3 and 4. But also some good laps.\"As a team result, that's really gone to plan. Lewis with his penalty gets the minimum penalty he can, and I'm on pole, so that should be good.\"Hamilton is anticipating a tough ask to challenge for a podium place.\"It was a really tricky session in general,\" Hamilton said.\"There were still some damp patches and getting the temperature in the tyres for the first lap wasn't easy, but a really great job by the team, so happy with the performance in terms of getting us out at the right time. Tomorrow's going to be difficult but I'll give it everything.\"Hamilton claimed his 100th race win last time out in Russia, and he added: \"It's not the easiest overtaking at the moment, and we're all on the same tyres as well. I imagine tomorrow's going to be difficult to move up. You saw in the last race what happened with Max once he got behind sixth place or something and vice versa for me also.\"We've got the long straight down the back, we'll see what we can do, hopefully we can give the fans here a good race.\"Despite spinning off the track at one stage in the session, Charles Leclerc recovered to take P4, and the Ferrari driver will start in third place behind Verstappen, who was pleased with his performance after a difficult Friday practice.\"It was quite tricky at the beginning with the conditions, but compared to yesterday we actually managed to turn it around quite well,\" said Verstappen. He is hunting his eighth win of the season, which would also see him equal Nigel Mansell as the driver with the second most victories with a Honda engine (13), behind the late Ayrton Senna (32).\"The laps overall were quite good, even if we lost a bit down the straight on the last, we have to look into that, but of course it was not the lap I needed to fight for pole,\" Verstappen added.\"Overall I'm very happy. We'll try to pick up as many points as we can.\"PROVISIONAL CLASSIFICATION1. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 1:22:868 *\n2. Valtteri Bottas (Mercedes) +0:130\n3. Max Verstappen (Red Bull) +0:328\n4.

    "articleBody": "Lewis Hamilton missed the chance to chalk up his 100th victory but did take over the lead in the world championship as France's Esteban Ocon steered his way through a chaotic Hungarian Grand Prix on Sunday to collect his first ever win. After a tactical error dropped pole-sitter Hamilton to last place, the Briton picked his way through the field, finally clawing his way past Ocon's Alpine teammate Fernando Alonso, to finish third behind the Frenchman and Sebastian Vettel in the Aston Martin. For 24-year-old Ocon, who controlled the race from the front, it marked a maiden win in his 78th Grand Prix and a first victory for the new-look Alpine set-up. \"What a moment! It feels so good!,\" said Ocon. \"It's fantastic, what can I say? Congrats to Fernando (Alonso) as well, I think the win is also thanks to him with the fight that he did. \"It's teamwork, it's been a fantastic day!\"Max Verstappen's Red Bull was damaged in a first lap crash, which took out five cars, and he eventually finished 10th, leaving Hamilton to take a six-point lead in the championship.\"Congratulations to the Alpine team and to Esteban for his first win -- he's been a shining star for a long time,\" said Hamilton who was booed again during his post-race interview by a section of the packed crowd who blame him for the crash at the British GP two weeks ago which took out Verstappen.\"Today was definitely tough, we always make it difficult for ourselves.\"Crazy to think we were the only ones on the grid at the start, but these things happen and we learn from them. I gave it everything and I have nothing left in the end.\"Mercedes also took over the constructors championship lead. Going into the summer break they are now 10 points ahead of Red Bull.Turn 1 chaos          \nTwo weeks after the controversial collision between Hamilton and Verstappen on the opening lap at Silverstone, there was early trouble again at the Hungaroring, this time prompted by Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas.With the rain coming down, the Finn triggered a series of collisions on the opening turn which not only took him out of the race but accounted for Red Bull's Sergio Perez, Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, the Aston Martin of Lance Stroll and the McLaren of Lando Norris.Bottas acknowledged he was at fault after being given a five-place penalty on the grid for the next race, the Belgian GP at Spa at the end of August.\"I think that's fair enough,\" said Bottas. \"I had a bad start and I lost the momentum. I misjudged the braking point and locked the wheels. \n\"I was responsible for hitting Lando and that meant he cut people off in front of him.\"It's not great for me and not great others. It's not like I did it on purpose.\"Seven-time world champion Hamilton, starting on pole for the 101st time in his F1 career, was ahead of the chaos in the rain and looked a nailed-on winner when he was on his own on the grid for the restart while the other cars were all changing tyres to suit the improved weather.Bizarrely, within one lap, Hamilton was at the back as Mercedes, having failed to switch his tyres, called him in. \"I was telling the team how the track was during the lap but they said the rain was coming when we got in the car so I thought they had other information,\" said Hamilton after the race.It marked the start of an epic race from the Briton which might well have ended in his 100th GP win had it not been from superb defensive driving from 40-year-old Alonso who prevented him closing on Vettel and Ocon.Ocon was also untouched by the first lap chaos and was second at the restart. With Hamilton's plight, the Frenchman took over the race lead.Four-time world champion Vettel pressed him hard but could not get close enough to mount a serious challenge."

He's very aggressive,\" Hamilton said. \"Today I was fully alongside him and he did let me into space.\"Hamilton was assessed a 10 second penalty but took it during a pit stop when running second and came back on to the track in fourth place.  \"Regardless of whether I agree with the penalty I just take it on the chin,\" he said.\"I'm not going to let anything get in the way of the crowd's enjoyment of the weekend and the national anthem and the British flag.\""

    "articleBody": "Max Verstappen inflicted more damage to Lewis Hamilton's Formula One title hopes as the Red Bull driver held on to win the inaugural sprint race at Silverstone.Verstappen started in second in the trial event ahead of the British Grand Prix, but a flying first lap saw him overtake championship rival Hamilton by the first corner.It was a lead which proved unassailable, the Dutchman cruising to a victory which sees him take pole position in Sunday's main race, as well as three championship points.Hamilton and team-mate Valtteri Bottas ensured it was not all bad for Mercedes as they claimed second and third on the grid, while Fernando Alonso was unable to sustain a brilliant start.Verstappen flew out of the blocks, with Hamilton unable to compensate when he attempted to skirt around the outside at the first corner, only to pull out of the manoeuvre.Bottas was hot on the tracks of the duo, while Alonso charged up from 11th to fifth with a first lap just as impressive as Verstappen's effort.The veteran Spaniard was unable to maintain it, though, dropping down to seventh as his soft tyres started to struggle.Further ahead, Hamilton – who set a blistering time in Friday's qualifying session – was demanding more from his team over the radio, yet he could not close the gap on Verstappen, who held a 2.3 second lead heading into the 17th and final lap.Hamilton managed to close in on the final straight, but Verstappen was the deserving victor in the first taster of F1's latest format tweak.There was less luck for Verstappen's team-mate Sergio Perez, however, with the Mexican crashing on Lap 7, dropping down to 18th before Red Bull called him back to retire in the pits, meaning they have drivers bookending both ends of the grid.Charles Leclerc came fourth, with Lando Norris capping a difficult week for him personally with an impressive drive to place himself fifth.George Russell dropped to ninth, though faces an investigation for an early incident involving Carlos Sainz."

It later transpired Mir had also committed the same offence and they were returned to their original positions. \nTOP 10 \n1. Fabio Quartararo (Monster Yamaha)\n2.

    "articleBody": "Max Verstappen claimed victory at a remarkable Emilia Romagna Grand Prix where Lewis Hamilton twice sustained damage and a crash involving Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas prompted a red flag.An epic race encouraged optimism for a genuine title tussle in Formula One in 2021, with drama right from the outset and Hamilton fighting hard to rescue a superb second-placed finish.The defending champion had started from pole, with Verstappen qualifying in third, behind Red Bull colleague Sergio Perez.But Verstappen claimed the lead from Turn One in the rain at Imola, racing up alongside Hamilton and forcing his championship rival wide, where he sustained right wing damage.While chaos ensued behind them, Hamilton held off Charles Leclerc to ensure he remained the biggest threat to Verstappen, with a tactical battle briefly allowed to develop.Verstappen pitted first on lap 28, with Hamilton following a lap later and coming out behind the Dutchman following a slow stop.But a manic spell then shook up the race again. First, Hamilton ran off into a gravel trap and desperately sought to reverse back onto the track.The Briton was limping back to the pit lane a lap down under a shower of sparks, emitted by his Silver Arrow, when a further incident brought out the safety car.Bottas collided with Mercedes prospect George Russell, driving for Williams, and both cars crashed in spectacular fashion, with the drivers emerging from the wreckage to angrily blame one another over the team radio.The red flag soon followed, with wreckage spread across the track and a 30-minute suspension required, giving Hamilton time to regroup.He resumed from ninth, able to unlap himself, with Verstappen forced to build a healthy lead again from Lando Norris after a slightly nervy restart.Verstappen had retired at each of the three Italian races in 2020 but avoided a similar fate this time and the focus in the closing stages was instead on Hamilton's progress.The Mercedes man picked off his opponents one by one, eventually streaking past Leclerc to move into position for a podium place once more.Only Norris in the McLaren stood between Hamilton and a phenomenal P2 and he patiently chased down his compatriot to limit the damage and somehow emerge from this race a point ahead of Verstappen.'AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT'As the race got back underway following his crash, Russell posted on Twitter: \"Thanks for all the messages. I'm fine, just disappointed.\"At the end of the day, it's an unfortunate incident. You're entitled to defend your position. But at 330kph, you have to respect the speed and the conditions when doing so. Gutted for the team. They deserved more today.\"That was the second crash that ruled a driver out, with Nicholas Latifi earlier colliding with Nikita Mazepin to almost instantly exit the grand prix.The subsequent safety car brought its own share of incident – Perez hit with a 10-second penalty after running wide and overtaking two cars to recover fourth.Mick Schumacher went into a wall under the safety car, meanwhile, and lost his front wing.TONE SET BEFORE THE STARTThe weather was always likely to cause havoc and the drivers took to the track to test their tyres ahead of the race. Even that did not go smoothly.Fernando Alonso crashed into the wall, while the brakes on the Aston Martin cars caught fire.That issue meant Sebastian Vettel had to start from the pitlane, and he was later given a 10-second stop/go penalty, too, for failing to have his wheels fitted in time.Bottas sustained a puncture on his way to the grid and then Leclerc span on the formation lap. It was one of those days."

    "articleBody": "Francesco Bagnaia targeted \"a really great result\" at the Qatar Grand Prix after setting a stunning lap record on his factory Ducati debut.Third-year MotoGP rider Bagnaia had finished 15th and 16th in his two seasons with Pramac Racing but has quickly focused on loftier ambitions following his bow with the factory team.Ducati - winners of the previous two Qatar GPs with the since-departed Andrea Dovizioso - had been fast all week at the season opener, with Jack Miller setting the practice pace in his 100th grand prix with a best time of one minute and 53.387 seconds ahead of second-placed team-mate Bagnaia.But Bagnaia later suggested he had believed he could run in less than 1:53 in qualifying and so it proved, a magnificent 1:52.772 setting a two-wheel lap record at the Losail International Circuit.That was enough for a healthy 0.266-second gap to Fabio Quartararo, while Bagnaia gave veteran Valentino Rossi - a four-time Qatar winner - a tow to take him to the front of the second row.Rossi has 10 podiums at Losail and his next in MotoGP will make him the first to 200.Even from his commanding position, Bagnaia could be forgiven for being pessimistic after his year-high six abandonments in 2020 - including five in the final eight races - but he was full of positivity following an outstanding display.\"I'm very happy,\" he said. \"Already yesterday I was thinking it was possible today to arrive at (1:)52.\"In the second attempt, when I started pushing, I thought it was possible. After the third sector, I was very close to this lap time.\"I'm very happy; my first pole position in my first race with this team. I would like to make everything possible to finish the race tomorrow in the best way possible. I think we can make a really great result.\"Miller had to settle for fifth, next to Rossi, as he pursues a third straight podium for the first time in his career following two to end 2020.Quartararo also had reason to be disappointed with his day as he mistimed his second run and the chequered flag denied him the opportunity to challenge Bagnaia.Another debutant at a factory team, Yamaha's Quartararo won the first two races of the season last year but has had only one podium in 12 outings since.The 21-year-old, who has colleague Maverick Vinales - the 2017 Qatar winner - behind him in third, said: \"It's a shame I couldn't do the second lap on my second run. I had the chequered flag for a second.\"But I'm quite happy. I think we did a great lap. We tried something in FP4 that was bad, honestly - I didn't feel great on the bike. But I feel that we have great potential for tomorrow.\"We will go with that bike for the race because it's the one that I feel good [on]. I think we made too much changes today, but I'm feeling happy.\"I think we did a great, great job in the qualifying. Now we're just missing the race. I can't wait.\"Neither the Ducatis nor the Yamahas should have to worry this weekend about defending champion Joan Mir, who failed to capitalise on the absence of Repsol Honda great Marc Marquez.Mir was forced to contend in Q1 and will start from 10th, having finished eighth in his only previous Losail entry in 2018.\nProvisional classification1.

    "articleBody": "Lewis Hamilton says his decision to only sign a one-year contract with Mercedes should not cause concern as he prioritises his drive for more diversity in Formula One.It took until February before seven-time world champion Hamilton and Mercedes finally announced they had come to terms on a new contract.The agreement was only for 2021, the last season before sweeping regulation changes come into the sport.Hamilton, 36, insists there should be no doubts over his commitment.The Briton also spoke of his passion to fight for change and equality in F1 and wider society.That will serve as his main focus in a year where he could surpass Michael Schumacher outright with an eighth title.\"I'm kind of in a fortunate position where I've achieved most of the stuff I wanted to achieve up until this point, so there's no real need necessarily to plan too far ahead in the future,\" Hamilton said at the launch of Mercedes' new W12 car.\"I'm fully invested in this season and delivering. I still love what I do.\"We're living through an unusual period of time in life and I just wanted one year. Then we can talk about if we do more, and keep adding it [by] one if we have to.\"I chose to have a one-year deal, so I can see where we are at. It doesn't mean I'm not committed.\"What I'm really focused on - there was a lot of discussion around the diversity issue, what is important is that we are delivering.\"Hamilton added: \"I'm really proud of my team, I'm already seeing steps to see that progress. That's my driving force to make sure we continue to push for accountability.\"The main priority for 2021 - in the past it was about just winning championships. But now it's really pushing for making real change.\"Last year there was discussion about equality and inclusion and there was a lot of talk this year about pushing for diversity and really making sure that action is taken.\"That's at the core of the drive for me, but of course we exist to win. That is what all these guys and girls here are working towards, so that's my goal to deliver it for them.\"Mercedes boss Toto Wolff echoed the comments of Hamilton and is not concerned about the short deal.Wolff said: \"No doubt about his commitment. First of all, he enjoys racing a lot. We enjoy working with each other and we discussed that a lot.\"But he’s absolutely right. The times change, new priorities for all of us in terms of the way we live, our health, he is very passionate about his initiatives against racism and inequality.\"Then we have this massive regulatory change in 2022 that is going to reshape what Formula One will be.\"I don't think this will play a role, but I think it's fair for a driver who has won seven championships to have the flexibility to decide what he wants to do in future.\"We have agreed that we want to pick up the discussions much earlier this year to avoid a situation like we had in 2020, to run out of time and be in the uncomfortable position that we have no time left before the beginning of the season.\"The 2021 season is scheduled to get under way with the Bahrain Grand Prix on March 28."

    "articleBody": "Mick Schumacher signed off from Formula Two by sealing the drivers' title in a thrilling second sprint race in Bahrain on Sunday.Ahead of his move to Formula One with Haas next season, Schumacher – the son of seven-time F1 champion Michael – took the F2 title ahead of Callum Ilott.The 21-year-old went into Sunday's race with a 14-point lead in the standings after recovering from a qualifying crash that forced him to start from P18 by taking sixth – following a penalty for future Haas team-mate Nikita Mazepin – and claiming two bonus points for the fastest lap.Despite a good start from third, a lock-up into turn four eventually damaged Schumacher's hopes, with him forced to take a non-mandatory pit stop for fresh tyres after being overtaken by Ilott and slipping from third to sixth on lap 19 of 34.However, Ilott was unable to close in on race winner Jehan Daruvala and runner-up Yuki Tsunoda and he fell away and ended up crossing the chequered flag outside of the point places.Schumacher set the fastest lap after pitting for new rubber, though he did not receive the two bonus points because he finished outside the top 10.The German consequently added F2 glory to his Formula Three championship in 2018, finishing the 2020 season with two race wins and a further eight podiums."

    "articleBody": "Paul scored 14 of his 28 points in the fourth quarter as Western Conference top seeds Phoenix broke open a close game, withstanding a 35-point performance from Mavericks star Luka Doncic.There was less drama in Miami, where the East's top-seeded Heat again capitalized on the injury absence of Philadelphia star Joel Embiid as they rolled to a 119-103 victory over the 76ers to take a 2-0 lead in their best-of-seven series.Dallas, trying to head home for games three and four with a split of two games in Phoenix, took a 60-58 lead into halftime.But the Mavs had no answer for Paul, who keyed a 23-2 fourth quarter scoring run that effectively sealed it for Phoenix with minutes to spare.Devin Booker scored 21 of his 30 points in the second half for the Suns, who connected on a franchise playoff record 64.5% of their shots from the field. That included 52% from three-point range as the Suns drained 13 baskets from beyond the arc.\"(We) just had to be a little bit more aggressive,\" Paul said. \"That second quarter we started turning it over. They got it going. Shooters were making shots and we just wanted to stay the course.\"Booker helped launch the turnaround with back-to-back three pointers early in the third quarter, but the Suns' 89-83 lead heading into the final period of the physical, sometimes testy contest looked tenuous.Paul, however, took control, making six straight shots to gut-punch Dallas.\"We just did what we were supposed to do,\" Paul said as he looked to games three and four in Dallas starting on Friday. \"We won two games at home.\"That was the same sentiment voiced by Heat star Jimmy Butler in Miami.\"We did what we were supposed to do at home,\" Butler said. \"The series really starts when you take it to the road.\"Bam Adebayo scored 23 points and pulled down nine rebounds and Butler added 22 and 12 assists for Miami.Tyrese Maxey scored a game-high 34 points for Philadelphia, Tobias Harris added 21 and James Harden had 20.But three-time scoring champion Harden was held to just four points in the second half, as the Heat, who trailed briefly in the first quarter but led 60-52 at halftime, comfortably kept the Sixers at bay.\n                  \n- Not enough shots -     \n             \nTyler Herro scored 16 of his 18 points in the first half off the bench and made three of his five three-point attempts for Miami.Victor Oladipo came off the bench to score 19 points and was an even more efficient three-of-four from beyond the arc as the Heat made 14 three-pointers.The Sixers, meanwhile, struggled from three-point range, connecting on just eight of their 30 attempts.\"When it comes down to it, you've got to make shots, especially on the road,\" Harden said. \"We got enough stops when we need to, had numerous chances. You know (if) we make a couple of shots that gives us more confidence and it puts more pressure on them.\"I feel like we never really put that pressure on them throughout the course of the game.\"The series resumes on Friday, and it's not clear when Embiid will return after suffering a concussion and orbital fracture in the series-clinching win over Toronto.\"He's got so many steps to go through,\" Sixers coach Doc Rivers said. \"I don't think he's cleared any of them right now. So we just have to wait and see.\""
