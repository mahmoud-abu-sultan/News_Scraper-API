It has been a difficult road to healing in the past few weeks, but I am happy that things are getting better,\" he said.\n\nKhachanov defeated Czech Jiri Lehecka 6-2, 6-4 to reach the Miami last 16 for the first time.\n\nFrench qualifier Quentin Halys hit 15 aces as he beat American Mackenzie McDonald 7-6 (7/2), 6-3."
